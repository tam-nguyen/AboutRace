Drug metabolism can be influenced by the rate at which drugs are transported into cells, the rate at which they are broken down inside of cells, the rate at which they are excreted, etcetera. Genes influence these processes because these processes are conducted by enzymes and transport proteins. However, environmental factors also play a strong role. Diet, for instance, may increase the production of a relevant enzyme. It may provide co-factors that allow the enzyme to act more efficiently or it may inhibit an enzyme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some drugs or classes of drugs, studies have shown differences in the statistical mean drug response between study subjects from different races. For instance, one review article reported that there is a statistically significant difference between white people (of some nationality) and Chinese people (one nationality of Asian people) in the amount of the anticoagulant warfarin needed to maintain a therapeutic dose. The average dose for Chinese people was 50% less than the average dose for white people. Yet, these data directly contradict what the genetic data predict. We know of at least one gene that has a significant effect on warfarin metabolism, and we know which versions of the gene produce efficient warfarin metabolism in the test tube. If we only looked at genetics, we would think that white people would need, on average, less of the drug to obtain a therapeutic dose. (Xie, et al., \"Molecular Basis of Ethnic Differences in Drug Disposition and Response,\" Annual Rev. Pharmacol and Toxicol. 2001. 51:815-50.) Furthermore, studies have shown that Japanese people (a nationality of Asian people) in Japan require a lower dose of warfarin than Japanese people in the US to achieve a therapeutic dose.

In any given study, the answers you get may depend on which white people or which Asian people or which black people you are studying.

Are these white people in the United States or in France, or Chinese people in China or the United States? The answer may also depend on whether you are studying people who are a majority or a minority. And whether you are studying people who are wealthy or poor.

It's dangerous to assume that if you see a difference it's due to genetics.

Drug metabolism can be influenced by the rate at which drugs are transported into cells, the rate at which they are broken down inside of cells, the rate at which they are excreted, etcetera. Genes influence these processes because these processes are conducted by enzymes and transport proteins. However, environmental factors also play a strong role. Diet, for instance, may increase the production of a relevant enzyme. It may provide co-factors that allow the enzyme to act more efficiently or it may inhibit an enzyme.</p>\n\n<p>For some drugs or classes of drugs, studies have shown differences in the statistical mean drug response between study subjects from different races. For instance, one review article reported that there is a statistically significant difference between white people (of some nationality) and Chinese people (one nationality of Asian people) in the amount of the anticoagulant warfarin needed to maintain a therapeutic dose. The average dose for Chinese people was 50% less than the average dose for white people. Yet, these data directly contradict what the genetic data predict. We know of at least one gene that has a significant effect on warfarin metabolism, and we know which versions of the gene produce efficient warfarin metabolism in the test tube. If we only looked at genetics, we would think that white people would need, on average, less of the drug to obtain a therapeutic dose. (Xie, et al., \"Molecular Basis of Ethnic Differences in Drug Disposition and Response,\" Annual Rev. Pharmacol and Toxicol. 2001. 51:815-50.) Furthermore, studies have shown that Japanese people (a nationality of Asian people) in Japan require a lower dose of warfarin than Japanese people in the US to achieve a therapeutic dose.

On the other hand, people in the southern part of Africa - or people whose ancestry goes back to the southern part of Africa - don't have high sickle cell carrier rates because that allele is selected for only in human beings who have lived where there's a high incidence of malaria, which you don't find in southern Africa.
