Why doesn't it make sense to group humans the same way?</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>Subspecies are animal groups that are related, can interbreed, and yet have characteristics that make them distinct from one another. Two basic ingredients are critical to the development of separate subspecies: isolation and time. Unlike most animals, humans are a relatively young species and we are extremely mobile, so we simply haven't evolved into different subspecies.</p>\n\n<p>The earliest hominids evolved from apes about 5 million years ago, but modern humans (Homo sapien sapiens) didn't emerge until 150,000-200,000 years ago in eastern Africa, where we spent most of our evolution together as a species. Our species first left Africa only about 50,000-100,000 years ago and quickly spread across the entire world. All of us descended from these recent African ancestors.</p>\n\n<p>Many other animal species have been around much longer or they have shorter lifespans, so they've had many more opportunities to accumulate genetic variants. Penguins, for example, have twice as much genetic diversity as humans. Fruit flies have 10 times as much. Even our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, has been around at least several million years. There's more genetic diversity within a group of chimps on a single hillside in Gomba than in the entire human species.</p>\n\n<p>Domesticated animals such as dogs also have a lot of genetic diversity, but this is mostly due to selective breeding under controlled conditions. Humans, on the other hand, have always mixed freely and widely. As a result, we're all mongrels: Eighty-five percent of all human variation can be found in any local population, whether they be Kurds, Icelanders, Papua New Guineans, or Mongolians. Ninety-four percent can be found on any continent.</p>\n\n<p>Animals are also limited by habitat and geographical features such as rivers and canyons, so it is easy for groups to become isolated and genetically distinct from one another. Humans, on the other hand, are much more adaptable and have not been limited by geography in the same way. Early on, we could ford rivers, cross canyons, move great distances over a relatively short time, and modify our environment to fit our needs. We are also extremely mobile as a species. Even the remotest island tribe in the Pacific originally came from elsewhere and maintained some contact with neighboring groups.</p>\n\n<p>We may think global migration is a recent phenomenon, but it has characterized most of human history. Whether we're moving halfway around the world or from one village to another, the passage of genes takes place under many circumstances, large-scale and small: migration, wars, trade, slave-taking, rape, and exogamous marriage (marriage with \"outsiders\").</p>\n\n<p>It takes a long time to accumulate a lot of genetic variation because new variants arise only through mutation - copying errors from one generation to the next. On the other hand, it takes just a very small amount of migration - one individual in each generation moving from one village to another and reproducing - to prevent groups from becoming genetically distinct or isolated. Humans just haven't evolved into distinct subgroups.</p>\n\n<p>But we can see obvious differences between people - don't those translate into deeper differences, like propensity for certain diseases?</p>\n\n<p>The visual differences we are attuned to don't tell us anything about what's beneath the skin. This is because human variation is highly non-concordant. Most traits are influenced by different genes, so they're inherited independently, not grouped into the few packages we call races. In other words, the presence of one trait doesn't guarantee the presence of another. Can you tell a person's eye color from their height? What about their blood type from the size of their head? What about subtler things like a person's ability to play sports or their mathematical skills? It doesn't make sense to talk about group racial characteristics, whether external or internal.</p>\n\n<p>Genetic differences do exist between people, but it is more accurate to speak of ancestry, rather than race, as the root of inherited diseases or conditions. Not everyone who looks alike or lives in the same region shares a common ancestry, so using \"race\" as a shorthand for ancestry can be misleading. Sickle cell, for example, often thought of as a \"racial\" disease afflicting Africans, is actually a gene that confers resistance to malaria, so it occurs in areas such as central and western Africa, the Mediterranean, and Arabia, but not in southern Africa. In medicine, a simplistic view can lead to misdiagnoses, with fatal consequences. Racial \"profiling\" isn't appropriate on the New Jersey Turnpike or in the doctor's office. As evolutionary biologist Joseph Graves reminds us, medicine should treat individuals, not groups.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the social reality of race can have biological effects. Native Americans have the highest rates of diabetes and African American men die of heart disease five times more often than white men. But is this a product of biology or social conditions? How do you measure this relationship or even determine who is Native American or African American on a genetic level? Access to medical care, health insurance, and safe living conditions can certainly affect medical outcomes. So can the stress of racism. But the reasons aren't innate or genetic.</p>\n\n<p>Believing in race as biology allows us to overlook the social factors that contribute to inequality. Understanding that race is socially constructed is the first step in addressing those factors and giving everyone a fair chance in life.</p>"}},{"id":"17138c46-4520-41ea-b5ac-53bd0629f2f7","field_old_article_discl":{"processed":"<p>NOTE: This article was <a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/MEDICINE-AND-PEOPLE-OF-COLOR-Unlikely-mix-2628151.php\">originally published</a> in the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> in 2003, and is included here for reference.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Troy Duster"},"field_author_bio":{"processed":"<p>Troy Duster is Professor Emeritus of Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>"},"field_copyright":{"processed":"<p>San Francisco Chronicle, Monday, March 17, 2003</p>"},"title":"Unlikely mix -- Race, biology and drugs","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"be792eba-e162-4441-abb6-f7c943962a6d","name":"Science: Pseudoscience","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"8661596c-176b-4527-97c4-af0e614da9d8","name":"Science and Pseudoscience"}]}},{"id":"df7f4876-b1fa-4aa8-b905-57d5e7f14f65","name":"Who Gets to Be American: Othering and Stereotypes","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4f251c2c-b851-45bf-ba32-ddb563cca5ae","name":"Who Belongs as an American?"}]}}],"field_article_related_content":[{"__typename":"node__article","title":"The Misuse of Race in Medical Diagnosis","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Here is the crux of the problem: My daughter's race can never be known.

Of the 314 African Americans in the sample, a total of 13 had HIV infections, including four women who received placebos. News media around the country picked up the spontaneously revised VaxGen message and broadcast loudly that blacks had a \"78 percent protection\" from this vaccine. Even more problematic, four Asian Americans were infected, a few more were not -- and there was a suggestion that the vaccine might work on people of color.</p>\n\n<p>As any statistician will testify, the number of African Americans and Asians is so small that one can have no confidence in these \"findings.\" But that is precisely where the story starts to get interesting. To understand why, it is necessary to place the VaxGen story in the wider context of a controversy that is stirring deep and strong divisions in the fields of pharmacogenomics, epidemiology and pharmacotoxicology -- the appropriate role, if any, of race, in the effective delivery of drugs and vaccines.</p>\n\n<p>This controversy will surely hit the headlines before the end of year, because in late fall we will learn the fate of a drug designed to be marketed specifically for blacks with heart disease. In what has been touted as \"the first ethnic drug,\" the biotech firm NitroMed received a green light from the Food and Drug Administration in March 2001 to proceed with a full-scale clinical trial, \"the first prospective trial conducted exclusively in black men and women suffering from heart failure.\" The drug is BiDil, and the study has been endorsed by the Association of Black Cardiologists. </p>\n\n<p>The BiDil story has some fascinating parallels with the VaxGen story. BiDil is a drug designed to restore low or depleted nitric oxide levels to the blood to treat or prevent cases of congestive heart failure. It was originally designed for a wide population base, and race was irrelevant. But the early clinical studies revealed no compelling results, and an FDA advisory panel voted 9 to 3 against approval.</p>\n\n<p>In a remarkable turn of fate, however, BiDil was suddenly born again as a racialized intervention. This new BiDil trial reflects two problematic assumptions about race and medicine:</p>\n\n<p>The first is that African Americans' risk of developing and dying from heart failure is twice that of whites. This claim has been floating around in the scientific literature for a decade, mainly uncontested. Jonathan Kahn of the University of Minnesota, has just completed some remarkable scientific sleuthing on the topic, however, and has shown that the NitroMed claim about the scope of black and white differences is simply untrue. Kahn traced the citation sources back nearly two decades, and has demonstrated conclusively that the difference between blacks and whites is actually closer to 1.2 to 1. There is a difference, but it is nowhere near the 2-to-1 ratio that would warrant special trials for one population group. Thus, substantial scaffolding of the BiDil clinical trial is based upon incorrect statistical data on racial disparities.</p>\n\n<p>The second claim is that BiDil has a special effect greater on African Americans than whites. The clinical trials now under way are not designed to test that hypothesis. Rather, by concentrating only on blacks, the study can have little or nothing compelling to say about comparative results, by race.</p>\n\n<p>Why the mistake, and what is at stake? Part of the answer lies in the role of prospective markets for biotech products. While the new mantra of biotechnology is to claim that pharmaceuticals will someday soon be marketed to individuals based upon their DNA, the fundamental truth is that selling drugs is about markets. These markets are not about individual designer drugs, but about groups and population aggregates that become the target market.</p>\n\n<p>In a classical piece of epidemiological research, Michael Klag and his associates showed a decade ago that, in general, the darker the skin color, the higher the rate of hypertension for American blacks, even inside the African American community. Klag indicated that the issue was not biological or genetic in origin, but biological in effect due to stress-related outcomes of reduced access to valued social goods such as employment, promotion, housing stock, etc. The effect was biological, not the origins.</p>\n\n<p>It is difficult to bring anti-discrimination to the market, and as time goes by, it is harder and harder to bring it to the government's attention. But racialized drugs? They may soon be on the drugstore shelves.</p>"}},{"id":"5c399d5d-6d46-449d-aab1-dcb77fdf1835","field_old_article_discl":{"processed":"<p>NOTE: This article was originally published in 2004, and is included here for reference.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"field_author_bio":{"processed":"<p>Larry Adelman is Series Executive Producer of RACE - The Power of an Illusion and co-director of California Newsreel.</p>"},"field_copyright":{"processed":"<p>© 2003 California Newsreel.

They tended to run away from slave plantations. He attributed this odd behavior to a disease peculiar to Negroes. He even gave the affliction a name, \"drapetomania.\" </p>\n\n<p>Cartwright's \"run-away\" disease elicits derisive laughter today. So too do all the other 19th and early 20th century exertions to distinguish races by facial angle, skull size, cranial index, length of shin bone and blood type. Our growing knowledge of the genome and human evolutionary history help us understand why all such efforts to locate the source of innate racial difference were doomed: it doesn't exist. Most geneticists and anthropologists who study human variation agree that humans just don't come bundled into three or four separate groups according to skin color and other physical traits. </p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, \"discoveries\" of racial difference resurface in the press with predictable regularity. Often they spotlight differential rates of diseases, or responses to a drug. Sometimes they zero in on a genetics study.</p>\n\n<p>That was the case recently with a report published in Science magazine (Dec. 20, 2002). Noah Rosenberg, Marcus Feldman and others analyzed the variation in 377 different DNA sequences from 1056 individuals from around the world. They found that 95% of the DNA variation they studied is due to differences between individuals within any continent. But they also found they could use the remaining 5% of the variation as genetic \"footprints\" indicating the continent from which an individual's recent ancestors came. </p>\n\n<p>Some were quick to interpret these results as evidence that old-fashioned notions of the \"races of man\" have been correct all along. But does it? What do these studies actually tell us? And why should our interpretations matter?</p>\n\n<p>Reports about such studies commonly fall prey to three confusions: they conflate DNA markers of ancestry with markers of race. They mistake the fact that some gene variants are more common in some populations than others as signs of racial \"difference\" between those populations. And they assume that disparities in group outcomes can be attributed to inborn, or genetic, differences between races. </p>\n\n<p>The idea of biological race assumes traits come packaged together, even color-coded for our convenience, as anthropologist Jonathan Marks jokes. In otherwords, if biological race were real, we'd find that skin color or other \"racial\" markers would correlate with a suite of other genetic traits. Knowing an individual's \"race\" should enable us to predict his or her other genes and traits.</p>\n\n<p>But the DNA sequences studied by Rosenberg and his colleagues are not genes. Known by geneticists as \"microsatellite short tandem repeats\" (and more colloquially as \"junk DNA\"), they do not code for proteins, but just sit there taking up space in our DNA. Mutations in DNA sequences that don't code for anything are not affected by natural and sexual selection. They are neither selected for nor against but are simply passed down, generation to generation. Comparing these accumulated mutation patterns can provide clues to ancient population movements. But they have no effect on physical traits such as skin color or hair form or blood type.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the study accomplished the same thing our eyes do everyday. You can look at someone and stand a pretty good chance of identifying the continent where that person's recent ancestors lived, especially if you're gazing at someone whose family has resided in the same place for several generations - as did all the subjects of the study. </p>\n\n<p>But what's that got to do with \"race\"? We all have ancestors from elsewhere - and if we go back far enough, about 70,000 or so years ago, all our ancestors can be traced back to Africa. But if our idea of race assumes that different groups each share among themselves a different suite of inborn traits, then we have to ask, \"What difference makes a difference?\" Certainly not micro-satellite short tandem repeats.</p>\n\n<p>Still, there's no question that some gene forms show up more often in some populations than others: alleles that code for blue eyes, or the A, B, O blood groups, and of course, those alleles that influence skin color. (We all have the same 30,000 or so genes. But some genes come in different forms, or varieties, called alleles.) But just because some members of a population might carry a specific gene form, doesn't mean all members do. Only a small percentage of Ashkenazi Jews carry the Tay-Sachs allele. When a couple I know were screened upon their pregnancy, the non-Jewish partner was found to be the Tay-Sachs carrier, not the Jewish one.</p>\n\n<p>That's because most human variation falls within, not between populations. About 85% of all genetic variation can, on average, be found within any local population, be they Swedes, Kikuyu, or Hmong. About 94% can be found within any continental population, consistent with what the Rosenberg Science study found. In fact, there are no characteristics, no traits, not even one gene that turns up in all members of one so-called race yet is absent from others. </p>\n\n<p>Take sickle cell. Doctors were long taught that sickle cell anemia was a genetic disease of Negroes, a marker of their race. Yet sickle cell is found among peoples from central and western Africa, but not southern Africa. It is also carried by Turks, Yemenis, Indians, Greeks, and Sicilians. That's because sickle cell arose several thousand years ago as a mutation in one of the genes that codes for hemoglobin. The mutation soon spread to successive populations along the trade routes where malaria was common. It turns out that inheriting one sickle cell allele confers resistance to malaria and thus provides a selective advantage in malarial regions (inheriting sickle cell alleles from both parents causes sickle-cell disease). In other words, sickle cell, like tandem repeats in the Science study, is a marker not of skin color or race but ancestry, or more precisely, having ancestors from where malaria was common. </p>\n\n<p>Like sickle cell, most traits are influenced by separate genes and inherited independently one from another. They are said to be \"non-concordant.\" Someone with brown hair might carry A, B or O blood. Sub-Saharan Africans tend to have dark skin. But so too do Dravidians from India, Aborigines from Australia, and Melanesians from the South Pacific. Large numbers of West Africans are lactose intolerant as are Japanese, but East Africans aren't. German and Papua New Guinean populations have almost exactly the same frequencies of A, B and O blood. At one point on the genome an individual might share a gene form common in Africa, at another site East Asia, and still another, Europe. Jared Diamond and others have pointed out that for each trait we can classify people into \"races\" by that trait, each giving us different and overlapping races depending on the trait selected.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, the Rosenberg team found they could cluster the individuals in their sample into several different statistically significant groups, only one of which corresponded to five continents. They also found that no matter which clustering scheme they used, individuals could be placed in more than one group. </p>\n\n<p>The reason for all this within-group variation is because unlike most other species, modern humans, Homo sapiens sapiens, are young, only about 150,000 years or so old, and we've always moved. As humans migrated around the globe, populations bumped into each other and shared their mates - and genes. Sometimes genes flowed across great distances - through trade, war, slavery, piracy, exile and migration. More often they flowed from village to village to village. Human populations just haven't been isolated from each other long enough to evolve into separate sub-species, or races.</p>\n\n<p>Ancestry is important in genetics and health care. I would like to know if I were descended from a population at risk for sickle cell, or the blood disease porphyria, or Tay Sachs. Oliver Sachs has even written famously of an island of the colorblind. But because of non-concordance, the geographic shape of populations at genetic risk for a specific disease or adverse drug response change amoeba-like depending upon the trait under study. These populations do not map onto what we think of as race. To assume they do is medically troublesome on several accounts. </p>\n\n<p>First, doctors might be tempted to use race as a very unreliable surrogate for an individual's own unique ancestry and patterns of inheritance. And insofar as 94% of all genetic variants can be found within any continent, assigning someone to a \"racial\" continent of origin is too gross a scale to narrow down the range of possibilities very much. (Some variants do correlate on a finer scale with ethnic groups, and on a scale smaller yet with recent family descent.)</p>\n\n<p>But a belief in biological race also obscures the very salient consequences of race as lived experience. Race may be a biological myth, a social construction, but it nonetheless remains very real. It can even have biological effects. African Americans have among the highest rates of hypertension in the world. This was long assumed to be genetic, a \"marker\" of their nature. But then it was found that West Africans have among the world's lowest hypertension rates. A focus on race as innate biology, as genetic difference, would lead health professionals and policy makers to overlook social factors that might contribute to African American hypertension and heart disease, including the added stressor of living in a racist society. </p>\n\n<p>Race is terribly relevant to life outcomes. The likelihood that toxic waste has been dumped in your neighborhood, your ability to get a home loan, the quality of your kid's education, connections to job opportunities, whether or not you're likely to be followed in a department store or pulled over by police, are all influenced by your race. Race does matter. Not race as genetics but race as lived experience, what sociologists call \"social\" race. Social race is an important variable for health researchers and epidemiologists.</p>\n\n<p>The factors that lead to differential outcomes between races live not in any \"racial\" genes but in our social institutions and practices. It's easy to confuse the two. But doing so, like Dr. Cartwright's drapetomania, displaces our attention from those discriminatory practices to the \"nature\" of the victims. Blindness to the continuing impact of racism can be just as harmful as believing that race is biologically real. They both let society off the hook.</p>"}},{"id":"bc59df96-c13a-4d5d-8e6c-b322bd40644e","field_old_article_discl":{"processed":"<p>NOTE: This article was originally published in 2001, and is included here for reference.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks"},"field_author_bio":{"processed":"<p>Jonathan Marks is Professor of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

We can look back at the dress styles of the 1960s, which seemed entirely appropriate, normal, natural, at the time, and see them now as weird. Anthropology does this more broadly. It shows that the ideas we take for granted are not necessarily the way things have to be, maybe not even the way they actually are. It is an intellectual field that can be threatening - primarily because its very reason for being is to subvert existing social power structures and to question things we take for granted as natural about the way we are (Boas 1928).</p>\n\n<p>Now, one of the ideas we take for granted most strongly in our society is that races represent natural categories of people. That is to say, the human species comes packaged a small number of ways, even color-coded for your convenience: black, white, yellow, red. You belong to one of these categories. Your race is a property of your constitution, innate and assigned at birth. And by virtue of being in that category, you have more in common, particularly more of the fundamentally important things in common, with other people in the same category than with people in other categories.</p>\n\n<p>I want to begin by questioning that assumption. The earliest anthropologists in the mid-1800s recognized that there was an intimate connection between the way people think about the world and how they classify it. After all, this is how we make sense of the infinite jumble of things we are exposed to - we decide \"this\" is a kind of \"that,\" and slightly different from something else, which also a kind of \"that,\" but a different kind of \"that.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is particularly evident in social relationships centering on the family. You, for example, give the same name to four different people: your mother's sister, your father's sister, your mother's brother's wife, and your father's brother's wife. Of course, I am describing your aunts.</p>\n\n<p>Why should you put all those people in the same category? Your mother's brother's wife and your father's brother's wife aren't even genetically related. Your mother's sister and father's sister are genetically related to you, but they're on opposite sides of the family. Traditionally, they don't even have your family name; only your father's brother's wife has your family name.</p>\n\n<p>Well, the fact is that other people do it differently. They may have one term for an aunt on the father's side of the family and a different word for an aunt on the mother's side of the family. They may have one term for blood relatives and another for spouses of blood relatives. You might notice also that you differentiate by sex the names of your father's brother and father's brother's wife,- they are your uncle and aunt - but their children, both male and female, are all termed cousins. Why not differentiate male from female cousins as we do uncles and aunts? And we don't even have a word for the person married to your cousin (Schneider 1968).</p>\n\n<p>So people impose order on their social universe by classifying it, by deciding that these people cluster together under this name, and that they're different from those other people assigned a different name. These classifications sometimes match genetic relationships and sometimes diverge from them significantly. How we classify is not based on nature, not determined by nature, but is a construction of our social minds that we impose on nature to help us organize things, in this case our relatives.</p>\n\n<p>How did we come up with these social conventions for classifying our relatives as we do? We don't really know.</p>\n\n<p>We do know a bit more about how we came to classify species as we do, and the same general things hold true. Jorge Luis Borges (1965) writes of a Chinese encyclopedia that \"divides animals into: (a) belonging to the Emperor; (b) embalmed; (c) tame; (d) suckling pigs; (e) sirens; (f) fabulous; (g) stray dogs; (h) included in the present classification; (i) frenzied; (j) innumerable; (k) drawn with a very fine camels hair brush; (l) et cetera; (m) having just broken the water pitcher; (n) that from a long way off look like flies.\" This is apocryphal, of course, but it makes the point well: You have to classify animals somehow. Why not this way?</p>\n\n<p>If you go to the Bible you find that the ancient Hebrews classified animals too: see for example Leviticus, chapter 11 and Deuteronomy, chapter 14. They did it to decide what was ritually clean or unclean, and on that basis, what was edible or inedible (Douglas, 1966). And their criteria, which are entirely natural, were where the animal lives and how it moves. And so they divided the animals into flying animals, swimming animals, and walking or crawling animals. These divisions certainly work, although there are some areas where they do not map well onto our modern categories. The bat is classified with the birds, for example; and lizards and mice end up together.</p>\n\n<p>Our own modern scientific classification of animals is based on evolutionary relationships, common ancestry - although in fact scientists started categorizing animals this way about a century before they realized that was what they were doing.</p>\n\n<p>We, for example, are mammals. That was established in the year 1758, a hundred years before Darwin, by a Swedish biologist named Linnaeus. Mammals constitute a natural category. If you ask biology students, they will tell you we're mammals. Why? Because we nurse our young.</p>\n\n<p>Here is something the student probably can not tell you. Do we nurse our young because we are mammals, or are we mammals because we nurse our young? Let me rephrase the question: Why is milk so important in the great scheme of things that we should take our very name on that basis? Couldn't we come up with the same group using a different criterion, and so why don't we?</p>\n\n<p>For example, Aristotle more than two thousand years ago called land animals \"Quadrupedia\" (four-legged), and divided them into those that lay eggs and those that give birth to live offspring. Creating a category of four-legged creatures that give birth to live offspring gives you basically the same constellation of animals as the category of mammals (with a few exceptions, like the duck-billed platypus).</p>\n\n<p>Mammals actually have many features that distinguish them from reptiles, amphibians, fish, and birds - hair, for one thing. Some scientists in the 18th century actually did call this group \"Pilosa,\" or hairy things. But Linnaeus called us mammals, based on an anatomical feature that's only functional in half of our species, and then only rarely.</p>\n\n<p>So why did he do that?</p>\n\n<p>It turns out to have been a political gesture. In the 1750s, there was major controversy surrounding the practice of wet-nursing. Many middle- and upper-class women in Europe were sending their babies off to stay with poor women in the country to be fed, rather than nursing the infants themselves. Linnaeus was active in the movement opposing this practice. In fact he wrote a book on the virtues of breastfeeding your own children, how it was natural for mothers to do this, and how therefore wet-nursing was something unnatural and bad. Up to that time he had been calling mammals simply Quadrupedia, like Aristotle. Now he calls mammals Mammalia, and uses his \"objective\" scientific classification to make this point. He is saying the natural role of women is to nurse their own children - that is what is right, and that is what your family should do (Schiebinger, 1993).</p>\n\n<p>The point of all this is to show that what a biology student takes for granted as a fact of nature, that we are in our very essence a lactating species, is actually a fact of history - a political stand from the 18th century embedded into biology. It is true, of course, mammals are a natural unit and the group can be defined by nursing, but having a shared natural property doesn't make a group an objective category, simply \"out there\" to be discovered. It is not obviously the case that breastfeeding is the key feature that makes us mammals, any more than having a single bone in the lower jaw (which all Mammalia have, and only Mammalia have) is the key feature that would make us \"One-bone-in-jaw-malia.\" There's more here than nature.</p>\n\n<p>So: we make sense of our place in the universe by classifying; our classifications are not necessarily derived from nature; and even when they are derived from nature, they encode cultural information.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if there isn't a natural classification for the things we're interested in, we often come up with one anyway. For example, time is continuous, but we divide it into sixty-minute hours, twelve-hour days and nights, and seven-day weeks, with the days named after skygods. These are arbitrary conventions; we inherited these time divisions from the ancient Babylonians (Zerubavel, 1985).</p>\n\n<p>Here's the paradox. The classifications that are the most arbitrary, and the least natural, seem to be the ones that matter the most to us. People could be categorized in many ways. There are short people and tall people; people with straight teeth and crooked teeth; with wiry, muscular, or chunky body builds; with freckles; with more or less body hair. These are natural differences, but they're not very important to us.</p>\n\n<p>What is important? Whether you're an American or an Iraqi. Whether you're a Nazi, a Communist, a Democrat, or a Republican. An Oriole fan or a Yankee fan. Rich or poor. Us or them. These categories of history and of society, the categories of human invention, are far more important to our daily lives than the categories of natural variation in our species.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, people look different, but the people who hate each other the most are generally the people who are biologically the most similar --Irish and English, Hutu and Tutsi, Arab and Israeli, Huron and Iroquois; Bosnian, Croatian, and Serb. Group identifications and animosities, lives and life-and-death struggles, are rooted in cultural, social, political, and economic differences, not in biological differences. Biological difference can be recruited to reinforce them, because that makes human evil appear to be the result of nature, but nature is not at the root here.</p>\n\n<p>So returning to the issue of race, how old is the idea that there are, say, four kinds of people, each localized to a continent? The answer is that the first person to suggest it was a Frenchman named François Bernier in 1684.</p>\n\n<p>The ancient Egyptians and Greeks had recognized that people from different places looked different, that the Egyptians were more darkly complected than the Greeks, and less darkly complected than the Nubians, and all of them were lighter than the Scythians. Of course in those days, long travel was done over land, where the physical differences between neighboring peoples were more subtle and gradual.</p>\n\n<p>But by the end of the seventeenth century, most of the world had been visited by Europeans. Their typical mode of travel was by boat - you boarded in one place where the people looked a certain way, and several weeks later you got off at a port where the people looked quite different, for example in West Africa and East Asia (Brace 1995).</p>\n\n<p>It was our friend Linnaeus, once again, who in 1758 scientifically formalized the distinction among the continental populations of the world. The order Primates (a term Linnaeus coined) subsumed several genera, of which our genus Homo was one. Homo (Linnaeus thought) subsumed two species, Homo sapiens (us) and Homo nocturnus (incorporating the more anthropomorphic descriptions of the chimpanzee). So how many subspecies did the species Homo sapiens subsume?</p>\n\n<p>Linnaeus decided there were five subspecies of our species. One was Homo sapiens monstrosus, which included people with birth defects, and the other four were geographic. Those were white Europeans, yellow Asians, red Americans, and black Africans.</p>\n\n<p>Linnaeus maintained that he was simply doing to humans what he did to any other species, being scientific and objective in his categorizations. But if you read the characteristics he used to differentiate the geographic subspecies, you see that they're ridiculous over-generalizations, frequently outright slanders, and usually not even biological attributes at all.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, for example, Homo sapiens americanus is red, ill-tempered, and impassive. After a terse description of looks and personality of each group, Linnaeus proceeds to describe their dress and government. Americans paint themselves, Europeans wear tight-fitting clothes, Asians wear loose-fitting clothes, and Africans anoint themselves with grease.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it's easy to bash scientists from 250 years ago. The point I'm trying to make, however, is that this is very specifically the origin of the idea that there is a scientific and authoritative way to categorize people into four distinct groups (Hudson, 1996).</p>\n\n<p>The generation of scholars immediately after Linnaeus jettisoned the use of clothing as taxonomic criterion. But it's not until the middle of the present century that anthropologists began to question the empirical basis for generalizing continentally about the human species (Montagu, 1941). We now recognize that these are neither the discrete fundamental units of our species, nor are they even comparable biological subdivisions.</p>\n\n<p>The human species simply doesn't come packaged into something like zoological subspecies. Rather, what we find are local populations that are similar to other populations nearby and different from populations far away. This variation no more tells us there are four kinds of people than it tells us there are five or six or twelve or thirty-seven kinds of people (Montagu, 1963; Livingstone, 1962; Marks, 1995).</p>\n\n<p>If we focus on the people from the most geographically divergent places of the earth - say, Norway, Nigeria, and Vietnam - of course they look different. But what does that difference represent? There is no reason to think it represents primordial purity, as if once upon a time there were people living only in Oslo, Lagos, and Saigon. There have always been, as far as we know, people living in the rest of the Old World.</p>\n\n<p>Consider, for example, the people of South Asia - India and Pakistan. Many of them are darkly pigmented like Africans and have facial features similar to Europeans, yet they live on the continent of Asia. What do you do with these people? And if you put them in a separate group, then what about all the other people who look distinctive - Polynesians, New Guineans, Australians, North Africans?</p>\n\n<p>Our ideas about the small number of basic human groups have been shaped largely by accidents of European history - the ports of call for the merchant fleet - and by patterns of immigration into the United States. Immigrants to the United States have come disproportionately from the regions surrounding those ports of call.</p>\n\n<p>Africans are incredibly heterogeneous. When we think of Africans we often think of West Africans. But remember you have the tallest people in the world in parts of Kenya and the Sudan, and the shortest people in the world in parts of the Congo and the Central African Republic. The people of East Africa look different from the people of West Africa; the people of southern Africa look different too. There are populations of very variable facial features and skin tones.</p>\n\n<p>Why group them all together and distinguish them from Europeans and Asians? Answer: because it's a difference we want to emphasize for political reasons. Of course, when you do that, you create a classic empirical problem at the boundaries. Let's say you juxtapose a Negroid African race against a Euro-Mediterranean Caucasoid race, as anthropologists used to do. Here's the simple fallacy: it works for the Swedes and the Senegalese, but what about the Ethiopians and Iranians?</p>\n\n<p>Any way you compare them - physically, genetically - the African Ethiopians are more similar to the \"Caucasoid\" Iranians than they are to the people of Senegal. Why? Simple: they are closer geographically. Likewise, Iranians are more similar to Ethiopians than they are to Swedes. So how can you objectively put a boundary line between them and decide they're in different groups. Such a division is just not biologically true.</p>\n\n<p>Humans vary gradually in nature, yet for cultural reasons we partition them into races (just as we divide time, which is continuous, into discrete units of minutes, hours, and weeks).</p>\n\n<p>Race is intended to denote discrete basic subdivisions of the human species, equivalent to a subspecies of mice, within which there is little variability and among which there are discrete differences. These subdivisions do not exist objectively in the human species. Why? Two reasons: First, populations are adapted to the places they live. Since geography and climatic conditions vary gradually and continuously, so do the human populations occupying these spaces. And second, what Cole Porter called \"the urge to merge\" has its effect. That is, human populations interbreed with their neighbors: population A with population B, B with C, C with D. And of course, sometimes A with C or D - that is, with people from further away. All human populations have histories - they trade. None of them has been sitting isolated and untouched since the Pleistocene (and the failure to appreciate that, by the way, is one of the last great ethnocentrisms in modern science).</p>\n\n<p>This is why anthropologists no longer talk about races; we talk about populations. We talk about local, fluid, biocultural units. Those are what are out there in nature, as far as we can tell.</p>\n\n<p>Now, because what we have are fluid, biocultural, historical populations, not discrete subspecies, we run into a problem when we superimpose our preconceptions about heredity on genetic data. Let's imagine that Mom and Dad have a baby girl. For some reason Baby Girl either wants to, or has to, prove her racial identity. The ultimate arbiter of hereditary issues is science, the science of genetics. Mom and Dad look racially appropriate as does Baby Girl, but for some reason that's not enough. So Baby Girl is subjected to a genetic test to look for a specific genetic marker that her race has and that others don't.</p>\n\n<p>If we take her family back two more generations, we know she has four grandparents and eight great-grandparents. Did all eight have that genetic marker? Because if one of them didn't have it, there is a small but significant chance that Baby Girl inherited that racially \"wrong\" genetic marker. And that's precisely the problem. If one great-grandma was different - either she was from somewhere else, or she just inherited a different marker from one of her ancestors, or the genetic generalization was incorrect - then the \"wrong\" marker has a fifty-fifty chance of being passed on each generation.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, you could have a child who looks just like you and your spouse, but fails a genetic test to match her to your racial category on account of one great-grandparent (who may have been just as racially \"correct\" as the other seven). That's why you can't do a genetic test for race. Race and genetics don't map on to one another particularly well.</p>\n\n<p>This parallels, of course, the old miscegenation laws, which prohibited marriage between blacks and whites. If you're going to prohibit intermarriage, you have to define precisely who is black and who is white. The classic definition came to be known as the \"one drop of blood rule\" - any non-white ancestry made you non-white. In practice, one black great-grandparent defined you as legally black; seven white great-grandparents weren't enough to make you white (Wright, 1996; Pascoe, 1996).</p>\n\n<p>The technology is different today, but the cultural mind-set is the same. The problem is simple and anthropological. Race is inherited, but in a different fashion from biological heredity. Race is inherited according to no scientific laws, but rather by a commonsense or folk cultural system.</p>\n\n<p>Like the way we name our relatives, racial divisions are not determined by biology, and they don't map very well onto genetic relationships. In fact, races are simply named groups, nothing more. Naming is what confers meaning, and this is wonderfully illustrated by a photomontage from Newsweek a couple of years ago. They asked \"What Color Is Black?\" and showed that the category \"black people\" subsumes people who look very different. And that's precisely the point. A genetic test for \"black\" would be failed by half the people on that page of photographs (and not necessarily the lightest complected half either), and would even be failed by half the inhabitants of Africa. On the other hand, many non-Africans would \"pass\" the test.</p>\n\n<p>The key thing is to appreciate that race and genetics aren't from the same worlds. So it's not that one is good and the other is bad. It's that one is scientific, and the other provides a means of localizing yourself and others in a very subjective world of social relations. The difficulty comes when we confuse them for one another. It's not that race doesn't exist, an idea I occasionally see espoused in the newspaper; it's that race doesn't exist as a \"biological entity.\" It certainly exists as a symbolic, social category. That actually makes it culturally more real and more important than if it were biological.</p>\n\n<p>Race is not a category derived from genetics. But our folk views are very deep rooted. For example, I can see the sun rise, traverse a path across the heavens, and set over the opposite horizon; yet we now know, of course, that the sun doesn't go around the earth. It's an optical illusion. To a large extent the growth of science involves overturning those commonsense ideas and showing them to be better explained in other ways that aren't immediately apparent.</p>\n\n<p>There are four major categories of folk ideologies of heredity. The first is the one we've already discussed - the existence of human subspecies or \"taxonomism.\" The second is \"racism,\" the belief that a person is simply the embodiment of the group, and thereby possesses whatever attributes are assigned to the group. It's a folk theory of heredity because it confers innate properties upon people based just on membership, rather than through observation of what the person is really like.</p>\n\n<p>There is another component to this fallacy, and that is the relationship between what people don't do and what they can't do. The Bell Curve (Herrnstein and Murray 1994) argued from test scores to what the authors called \"cognitive ability\". In fact, however, we can't study abilities, we can only study performances; and the relationship between them contains an important asymmetry - ability is only one component of the performance you observe. Good performance implies abilities; but poor performance does not imply the lack of abilities. The very concept of ability - something endowed at birth, yet perceptible only after it's been developed - is not scientific, not genetic, not empirical, and exists as simply folk wisdom (Marks 1997).</p>\n\n<p>Third is \"hereditarianism,\" the idea that you are whatever is in your cells, that \"blood will tell\" because \"like begets like\". This idea goes back a long way in human history. The royal family is treated better than the average Londoner for that very reason. This mode of thought, obviously, has provided a justification for hereditary aristocracies for millennia.</p>\n\n<p>We see it in high-tech forms now, in the idea that genes, rather than blood, will tell. The problem here is that we know very little about the development of normal traits in people. Much of what we know comes from the study of pathology, and it's very tricky to infer normal function from the study of its breakdown. Imagine trying to figure out what the fuel injector in your car actually does by opening the hood, smashing it with a hammer, and observing the results. Since previously there was little coming out of your exhaust but now you see billows of black smoke, you might come to believe that you have isolated the \"smoke controller\". Well, of course, that's not what the fuel injector actually does - smoke emission is just a side effect of screwing it up.</p>\n\n<p>Let me give you a more concrete example. There is a rare disease called Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. It results from mutation of a gene located on the X chromosome that codes for the production of an enzyme called hypozanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT). The mutated gene cannot produce HGPRT, and without this enzyme you have Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Boys afflicted with this syndrome have an irresistible compulsion to flail and to bite. They end up biting their lips and fingers and require strong restraint.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the failure of this gene has a behavioral effect - a terrible, horrible effect. But what does this tell us about normal people who self-mutilate? What does it tell us about nail-biters like me? Or rituals of scarification? Or punks with pierced body parts? Or teenage girls with low self-image, who cut themselves? Absolutely nothing. The vast majority of self-mutilating behavior in our species occurs in people who don't have Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, people who are genetically normal. The gene for a bizarre pathological behavior tells us virtually nothing about the general occurrence of the behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, a geneticist can be quoted making precisely that connection in Scientific American (Beardsley 1995). It is actually a non-sequitur; an inference from folk heredity. And now we learn that social graces are controlled by a gene on the X-chromosome, based on a study of girls with Turner's syndrome (Angier 1997).</p>\n\n<p>The last major component of modern folk heredity is \"essentialism,\" the idea that we have to ignore apparent differences to find an invisible underlying uniformity. That is the basis for thinking there might be a genetic test for race, as we discussed earlier.</p>\n\n<p>In a recent study (Skorecki et al. 1997), it was determined that 54 percent of self-designated Hebrew priests, many of whom have the surname Cohen, had the same configuration of two genes on the Y-chromosome; as opposed to only 33% of Jews who did not think they were priests. On this basis the authors inferred that this one was the real genetic constitution of the Jewish priestly line inherited directly from biblical Aaron.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, often people with the same last names are going to be more closely related than people with different last names, reflecting recent common ancestry (known as isonymy). If you survey their Y chromosomes, you're going to find more homogeneity than you'd find in a random sample. Without a control group, to look at the Y chromosome in a sample of Horowitzes or Steinbergs for example, the inference that the one represented at 54 percent rather than 33 percent in Cohens is somehow distinguishing and authentic is dubious at best. But the result was reported in the New York Times nevertheless (Grady, 1997a, 1997b).</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, the authors of that report find themselves in the middle of an identity controversy; after all, people want to know authoritatively if they are \"really\" Hebrew priests or not. Of course, nobody's a Hebrew priest; there hasn't been a priesthood for centuries. Even so, these genetic data are invested with cultural authority, in spite of how shaky the inference is. The construction of identity is a political arena in which geneticists are uniquely unqualified to work. The failure to appreciate the responsibilities thus incurred contributed to the demise of the Human Genome Diversity Project (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1991; Mead, 1996).</p>\n\n<p>Let me conclude, then, with a diagnosis and a prescription. Genetics is a very important area of scientific research; we need it, and we need public understanding of it. But what is even more pressing is the need to understand the difference between scientific heredity (or genetics) and folk ideas on heredity. Geneticists should contribute to educating the public about these distinctions. There are three reasons why they haven't lived up to that responsibility. One, as cultural beings, geneticists have assimilated the same folk ideas as everyone else, and it is very hard to step out of their mind-set. Two, this is largely humanistic knowledge, outside the formal training of an average geneticist.</p>\n\n<p>The third reason is a bit more insidious. When geneticists tell you that genetics is the solution to social problems, personality problems, global problems, they may have a conflict of interest. In other words, sometimes geneticists are willing to exploit cultural ideas to justify scientific ones.</p>\n\n<p>To get the Human Genome Project off the ground, its first director, James Watson, told Time (Jaroff 1989), \"We used to think our fate was in the stars. Now we know, in large measure, our fate is in our genes.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now that, as Clarence Darrow used to say, would be interesting if true. But it raises a lot of questions. Do we have fates, in any significant sense of that term? Do we know they have been localized to our cellular nuclei? Is genetics really just hi-tech astrology, although presumably more accurate?</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that such a statement might be a true inference about nature, but obviously it's more than that. It's also a political statement about the immutability of one's place in the fabric of society. If we have fates and they are in our genes, then by implication the differences between a Harvard professor and an urban teenage gang member are explained by recourse to bands and blots and gels, and there would be little hope to change their life trajectories. Also, the statement encodes a political philosophy towards the social problems out there requiring solutions.</p>\n\n<p>To appreciate Watson's statement fully, you have to realize that it was also a grant proposal. It was made in the context of trying to raise 10 billion dollars of federal money to study genetics. Of course geneticists are going to tell you that what they study is the most important thing in your life. To the extent that folk ideologies about heredity reinforce the importance of genetics in the public eye, there's not much incentive to distinguish between them. It was true in the 1920s and it's true now.</p>\n\n<p>We face two questions. First, how do we get geneticists to distinguish between scientific and non-scientific ideas about heredity? (Because if they don't, the rest of us certainly can't be expected to.) And, second, how can we believe what geneticists say when they have an economic stake in the outcome of the research? It is the responsibility of the genetics community to confront these two problems, and it may require rethinking how geneticists are trained.</p>\n\n<p><br /><strong>References</strong></p>\n\n<p>Angier, N.

People need to understand these relationships and recognize that if we do the same thing we've always done, we're perpetuating inequality.</p>"},"changed":1532733822}],"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}},{"name":"Suburbs/Suburbanization","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Segregated Housing and the Racial Wealth Gap","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>As long as minorities are still barred from desirable communities and lose out on opportunities to accumulate wealth through rising property values, socioeconomic inequalities between racial groups will continue to be reinforced.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/d6496c4a4fa69484ccfc4c847216fa83-e219e7eeef7ed6a01062b712d491d368.png"}}}},{"title":"Racial Preferences for Whites: The Houses That Racism Built","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Racism doesn't just come dressed in white sheets or voiced by skinheads, but lies in institutions that, like the FHA, have quietly and often invisibly channeled America's wealth, power, and status disproportionately to white people.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/f188f438c2a2a0181c47cdd2625c6d02-6cfb2b646ada899d7713c775751d246b.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"What policies might integrate the suburbs and remedy some of the inequities that stem from residential segregation?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>The racial situation in America is in the interest of those who are racially privileged (i.e., whites) and nowhere does the rubber hit the road more than in real estate.

Forty-two percent of the net worth of all households consists of equity in their homes - that means for most Americans, their homes are their single largest asset.

But the policies they endorsed made it very difficult for minorities to attain the same resources and opportunities, resulting in deeply segregated communities and an enormous wealth gap between whites and nonwhites that persists to this day. In 1995, the median white family had over 8 times the net worth of the median Black family. The gap is even greater for Latinos - the median white household has over 12 times the wealth of the median Latino family.</p>\n\n<p>Race, wealth and life opportunities are intertwined in the United States. Today, white and nonwhite communities are still \"separate and unequal\" and the gap continues to grow, long after the Civil Rights era. Wealth, and the opportunities it affords, is passed down through successive generations. Along with it, Americans have also inherited a legacy of inequality that continues to shape the future. Segregation and the wealth gap between whites and nonwhites did not arise on their own. And because they are so deeply entrenched in the institutions that structure our society, they will not fade away by simply outlawing discriminatory policies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the state of segregation in the nation's metropolitan areas today? </strong></p>\n\n<p>The U.S. population is more racially and ethnically diverse than ever before. Yet for the most part, America's neighborhoods remain highly segregated. The only areas that have become more integrated since 1970 are cities with small minority populations.</p>\n\n<p>On the whole, segregation is highest in the major metropolitan areas of the Midwest and Northeast and lower in the West and South.</p>\n\n<p>The 2000 census shows that overall the nation's largest cities have lost large numbers of white residents to suburban and outlying areas. The urban populace is becoming increasingly Latino and Asian, with a slight increase in Black residents.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Lewis Mumford Center at the University of Albany, segregation has increased in almost every large suburban area from 1990 to 2000.</p>\n\n<p>Across the nation, four out of five whites live outside of the cities and 86 percent of whites live in neighborhoods where minorities make up less than 1 percent of the population. In contrast, 70 percent of Blacks and Latinos live in the cities or inner-ring suburbs.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Census Bureau's 1999 American Housing Survey, 74 percent of suburban residents owned their own homes, while only about half of urban residents are homeowners. The proportion is similar when you compare homeowners by race - in 1999, 74 percent of whites were homeowners, while only 45 percent of Latinos, 46 percent of Blacks and 51 percent of Asians owned their homes.</p>\n\n<p>Whites are still the most segregated of all racial groups, have the largest suburban presence and are most likely to own their homes. African Americans continue to be highly segregated and as Latinos and Asians gain a larger share of the population, they are becoming increasingly segregated from whites as well. </p>\n\n<p>When whites relocated to the suburbs, their strong tax base and businesses followed. The result: a huge discrepancy in the quality and quantity of resources, jobs and public services in central cities and inner-ring suburbs inhabited by mostly minority populations. As white communities continue the trend of isolating themselves and their resources, the pattern of flight and divestment repeats, and the wealth gap grows larger. </p>\n\n<p>Communities cannot be expected to accomplish integrated, stable neighborhoods on their own. In a 2002 study by the Harvard Civil Rights Project, analysts found evidence of an overwhelming trend toward school district resegregation. Court-ordered busing once made Southern schools the most integrated in the country. However, when many of these programs expired in the 1990s, the proportion of Black students in majority-white schools decreased by 13 percent. Until the problem of residential seclusion is addressed, schools will continue to resegregate by default.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But aren't some communities segregated by choice? What about the Chinatowns, Little Ethiopias and other ethnic enclaves?</strong></p>\n\n<p>People sometimes assume that certain ethnic or racial groups segregate themselves \"voluntarily,\" but there are many factors involved. These groups often face discrimination when they try to enter established, primarily white communities. Limited job and economic opportunities, language barriers, and shared culture can also influence many groups to cluster. Ethnic enclaves, however, are very different from impoverished urban ghettos. Apart from \"first-settlement\" immigrant neighborhoods, rarely do ethnic groups ever become as highly concentrated as many Black communities. Ethnic groups can tap into various types of resources unavailable to areas of concentrated poverty: networks of friends and relatives, \"niche\" occupations and businesses, etc. Furthermore, ethnic enclaves are more transitory in nature - as stepping stones to entering more privileged, resource-rich communities. Still, many groups (such as Latinos and Asians) will face more barriers based on racial discrimination as they look to move out. </p>\n\n<p>Confronted with racially discriminatory policies, minorities could not take advantage of the programs that made it possible for millions of people to buy homes in the suburbs. People of color remained in the cities while they witnessed their white counterparts leave in droves. Today, mostly minority inner cities are characterized by the unique phenomenon of concentrated poverty. Inner-city residents face intense spatial isolation and inadequate public resources, education and economic opportunities. As more and more people leave, costs for basic services rise and the poor become even poorer. The average inner city consists of abandoned buildings, total business disinvestment, and resource-depleted schools leaving it vulnerable to violent crime, prostitution, and drugs. By the time anti-discriminatory laws were passed, suburban whites were enjoying soaring property values and minorities now faced the economic barriers that replaced those initially created by race. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, after decades of segregation, a culture of poverty has become associated with people of color - particularly African Americans. Inner-city residents are not only surrounded by crime, drugs, homelessness and poverty, they are blamed for it. As john powell says, \"Not only have we racialized our space, but it is through space that we do our 'racing' in the 20th century.\" </p>\n\n<p><strong>How does discrimination, both past and present, continue to affect the life opportunities of nonwhites?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 1992, The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released a study showing that Black and Latino mortgage applicants are 60 percent more likely to be turned down for loans than whites, even when they share similar employment and financial backgrounds. </p>\n\n<p>According to a 1998 report by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), African-American mortgage applicants were rejected 217 percent as often as whites - up from 206 percent in 1995. Latino applicants were denied 183 percent as often as whites - up from 169 percent in 1995.</p>\n\n<p>According to a Department of Housing and Urban Development study, high-cost loans are offered five times more often in Black neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods. Furthermore, homeowners in upper-income Black neighborhoods were twice as likely to receive these sort of loans than homeowners in low-income white neighborhoods. In 1998, 9 percent of home loans in white neighborhoods were high cost compared to 51 percent of loans in Black neighborhoods.</p>\n\n<p>In 2003, we celebrate the 35th anniversary of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Nonetheless, housing discrimination persists in subtler forms. Minorities still experience discrimination on an individual level as well as through a variety of systematic practices. Realtors who practice racial steering will direct nonwhites to segregated areas or direct whites away from integrated areas. Minority mortgage applicants who are regularly denied loans more often than their white socioeconomic equals will by necessity turn to predatory lenders who charge them higher-cost loans than their credit histories warrant.</p>\n\n<p>As long as minorities are still barred from desirable communities and lose out on opportunities to accumulate wealth through rising property values, socioeconomic inequalities between racial groups will continue to be reinforced. Even if individual incidences of discrimination are no longer, the current housing market makes it almost impossible for a family with little or no assets to enter it.
