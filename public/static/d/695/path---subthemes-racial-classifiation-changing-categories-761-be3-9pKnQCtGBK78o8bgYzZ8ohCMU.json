Why doesn't it make sense to group humans the same way?</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>Subspecies are animal groups that are related, can interbreed, and yet have characteristics that make them distinct from one another. Two basic ingredients are critical to the development of separate subspecies: isolation and time. Unlike most animals, humans are a relatively young species and we are extremely mobile, so we simply haven't evolved into different subspecies.</p>\n\n<p>The earliest hominids evolved from apes about 5 million years ago, but modern humans (Homo sapien sapiens) didn't emerge until 150,000-200,000 years ago in eastern Africa, where we spent most of our evolution together as a species. Our species first left Africa only about 50,000-100,000 years ago and quickly spread across the entire world. All of us descended from these recent African ancestors.</p>\n\n<p>Many other animal species have been around much longer or they have shorter lifespans, so they've had many more opportunities to accumulate genetic variants. Penguins, for example, have twice as much genetic diversity as humans. Fruit flies have 10 times as much. Even our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, has been around at least several million years. There's more genetic diversity within a group of chimps on a single hillside in Gomba than in the entire human species.</p>\n\n<p>Domesticated animals such as dogs also have a lot of genetic diversity, but this is mostly due to selective breeding under controlled conditions. Humans, on the other hand, have always mixed freely and widely. As a result, we're all mongrels: Eighty-five percent of all human variation can be found in any local population, whether they be Kurds, Icelanders, Papua New Guineans, or Mongolians. Ninety-four percent can be found on any continent.</p>\n\n<p>Animals are also limited by habitat and geographical features such as rivers and canyons, so it is easy for groups to become isolated and genetically distinct from one another. Humans, on the other hand, are much more adaptable and have not been limited by geography in the same way. Early on, we could ford rivers, cross canyons, move great distances over a relatively short time, and modify our environment to fit our needs. We are also extremely mobile as a species. Even the remotest island tribe in the Pacific originally came from elsewhere and maintained some contact with neighboring groups.</p>\n\n<p>We may think global migration is a recent phenomenon, but it has characterized most of human history. Whether we're moving halfway around the world or from one village to another, the passage of genes takes place under many circumstances, large-scale and small: migration, wars, trade, slave-taking, rape, and exogamous marriage (marriage with \"outsiders\").</p>\n\n<p>It takes a long time to accumulate a lot of genetic variation because new variants arise only through mutation - copying errors from one generation to the next. On the other hand, it takes just a very small amount of migration - one individual in each generation moving from one village to another and reproducing - to prevent groups from becoming genetically distinct or isolated. Humans just haven't evolved into distinct subgroups.</p>\n\n<p>But we can see obvious differences between people - don't those translate into deeper differences, like propensity for certain diseases?</p>\n\n<p>The visual differences we are attuned to don't tell us anything about what's beneath the skin. This is because human variation is highly non-concordant. Most traits are influenced by different genes, so they're inherited independently, not grouped into the few packages we call races. In other words, the presence of one trait doesn't guarantee the presence of another. Can you tell a person's eye color from their height? What about their blood type from the size of their head? What about subtler things like a person's ability to play sports or their mathematical skills? It doesn't make sense to talk about group racial characteristics, whether external or internal.</p>\n\n<p>Genetic differences do exist between people, but it is more accurate to speak of ancestry, rather than race, as the root of inherited diseases or conditions. Not everyone who looks alike or lives in the same region shares a common ancestry, so using \"race\" as a shorthand for ancestry can be misleading. Sickle cell, for example, often thought of as a \"racial\" disease afflicting Africans, is actually a gene that confers resistance to malaria, so it occurs in areas such as central and western Africa, the Mediterranean, and Arabia, but not in southern Africa. In medicine, a simplistic view can lead to misdiagnoses, with fatal consequences. Racial \"profiling\" isn't appropriate on the New Jersey Turnpike or in the doctor's office. As evolutionary biologist Joseph Graves reminds us, medicine should treat individuals, not groups.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the social reality of race can have biological effects. Native Americans have the highest rates of diabetes and African American men die of heart disease five times more often than white men. But is this a product of biology or social conditions? How do you measure this relationship or even determine who is Native American or African American on a genetic level? Access to medical care, health insurance, and safe living conditions can certainly affect medical outcomes. So can the stress of racism. But the reasons aren't innate or genetic.</p>\n\n<p>Believing in race as biology allows us to overlook the social factors that contribute to inequality. Understanding that race is socially constructed is the first step in addressing those factors and giving everyone a fair chance in life.</p>"}},{"__typename":"node__article","id":"bc59df96-c13a-4d5d-8e6c-b322bd40644e","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>We make sense of our place in the universe by classifying; our classifications are not necessarily derived from nature; and even when they are derived from nature, they encode cultural information.</p>"},"field_old_article_discl":{"processed":"<p>NOTE: This article was originally published in 2001, and is included here for reference.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks"},"field_author_bio":{"processed":"<p>Jonathan Marks is Professor of Anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

If looked at from a distance, the way we see the world, which seems mundane, is actually exotic.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>To some extent this is recognizable from the study of history. We can look back at the dress styles of the 1960s, which seemed entirely appropriate, normal, natural, at the time, and see them now as weird. Anthropology does this more broadly. It shows that the ideas we take for granted are not necessarily the way things have to be, maybe not even the way they actually are. It is an intellectual field that can be threatening - primarily because its very reason for being is to subvert existing social power structures and to question things we take for granted as natural about the way we are (Boas 1928).</p>\n\n<p>Now, one of the ideas we take for granted most strongly in our society is that races represent natural categories of people. That is to say, the human species comes packaged a small number of ways, even color-coded for your convenience: black, white, yellow, red. You belong to one of these categories. Your race is a property of your constitution, innate and assigned at birth. And by virtue of being in that category, you have more in common, particularly more of the fundamentally important things in common, with other people in the same category than with people in other categories.</p>\n\n<p>I want to begin by questioning that assumption. The earliest anthropologists in the mid-1800s recognized that there was an intimate connection between the way people think about the world and how they classify it. After all, this is how we make sense of the infinite jumble of things we are exposed to - we decide \"this\" is a kind of \"that,\" and slightly different from something else, which also a kind of \"that,\" but a different kind of \"that.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is particularly evident in social relationships centering on the family. You, for example, give the same name to four different people: your mother's sister, your father's sister, your mother's brother's wife, and your father's brother's wife. Of course, I am describing your aunts.</p>\n\n<p>Why should you put all those people in the same category? Your mother's brother's wife and your father's brother's wife aren't even genetically related. Your mother's sister and father's sister are genetically related to you, but they're on opposite sides of the family. Traditionally, they don't even have your family name; only your father's brother's wife has your family name.</p>\n\n<p>Well, the fact is that other people do it differently. They may have one term for an aunt on the father's side of the family and a different word for an aunt on the mother's side of the family. They may have one term for blood relatives and another for spouses of blood relatives. You might notice also that you differentiate by sex the names of your father's brother and father's brother's wife,- they are your uncle and aunt - but their children, both male and female, are all termed cousins. Why not differentiate male from female cousins as we do uncles and aunts? And we don't even have a word for the person married to your cousin (Schneider 1968).</p>\n\n<p>So people impose order on their social universe by classifying it, by deciding that these people cluster together under this name, and that they're different from those other people assigned a different name. These classifications sometimes match genetic relationships and sometimes diverge from them significantly. How we classify is not based on nature, not determined by nature, but is a construction of our social minds that we impose on nature to help us organize things, in this case our relatives.</p>\n\n<p>How did we come up with these social conventions for classifying our relatives as we do? We don't really know.</p>\n\n<p>We do know a bit more about how we came to classify species as we do, and the same general things hold true. Jorge Luis Borges (1965) writes of a Chinese encyclopedia that \"divides animals into: (a) belonging to the Emperor; (b) embalmed; (c) tame; (d) suckling pigs; (e) sirens; (f) fabulous; (g) stray dogs; (h) included in the present classification; (i) frenzied; (j) innumerable; (k) drawn with a very fine camels hair brush; (l) et cetera; (m) having just broken the water pitcher; (n) that from a long way off look like flies.\" This is apocryphal, of course, but it makes the point well: You have to classify animals somehow. Why not this way?</p>\n\n<p>If you go to the Bible you find that the ancient Hebrews classified animals too: see for example Leviticus, chapter 11 and Deuteronomy, chapter 14. They did it to decide what was ritually clean or unclean, and on that basis, what was edible or inedible (Douglas, 1966). And their criteria, which are entirely natural, were where the animal lives and how it moves. And so they divided the animals into flying animals, swimming animals, and walking or crawling animals. These divisions certainly work, although there are some areas where they do not map well onto our modern categories. The bat is classified with the birds, for example; and lizards and mice end up together.</p>\n\n<p>Our own modern scientific classification of animals is based on evolutionary relationships, common ancestry - although in fact scientists started categorizing animals this way about a century before they realized that was what they were doing.</p>\n\n<p>We, for example, are mammals. That was established in the year 1758, a hundred years before Darwin, by a Swedish biologist named Linnaeus. Mammals constitute a natural category. If you ask biology students, they will tell you we're mammals. Why? Because we nurse our young.</p>\n\n<p>Here is something the student probably can not tell you. Do we nurse our young because we are mammals, or are we mammals because we nurse our young? Let me rephrase the question: Why is milk so important in the great scheme of things that we should take our very name on that basis? Couldn't we come up with the same group using a different criterion, and so why don't we?</p>\n\n<p>For example, Aristotle more than two thousand years ago called land animals \"Quadrupedia\" (four-legged), and divided them into those that lay eggs and those that give birth to live offspring. Creating a category of four-legged creatures that give birth to live offspring gives you basically the same constellation of animals as the category of mammals (with a few exceptions, like the duck-billed platypus).</p>\n\n<p>Mammals actually have many features that distinguish them from reptiles, amphibians, fish, and birds - hair, for one thing. Some scientists in the 18th century actually did call this group \"Pilosa,\" or hairy things. But Linnaeus called us mammals, based on an anatomical feature that's only functional in half of our species, and then only rarely.</p>\n\n<p>So why did he do that?</p>\n\n<p>It turns out to have been a political gesture. In the 1750s, there was major controversy surrounding the practice of wet-nursing. Many middle- and upper-class women in Europe were sending their babies off to stay with poor women in the country to be fed, rather than nursing the infants themselves. Linnaeus was active in the movement opposing this practice. In fact he wrote a book on the virtues of breastfeeding your own children, how it was natural for mothers to do this, and how therefore wet-nursing was something unnatural and bad. Up to that time he had been calling mammals simply Quadrupedia, like Aristotle. Now he calls mammals Mammalia, and uses his \"objective\" scientific classification to make this point. He is saying the natural role of women is to nurse their own children - that is what is right, and that is what your family should do (Schiebinger, 1993).</p>\n\n<p>The point of all this is to show that what a biology student takes for granted as a fact of nature, that we are in our very essence a lactating species, is actually a fact of history - a political stand from the 18th century embedded into biology. It is true, of course, mammals are a natural unit and the group can be defined by nursing, but having a shared natural property doesn't make a group an objective category, simply \"out there\" to be discovered. It is not obviously the case that breastfeeding is the key feature that makes us mammals, any more than having a single bone in the lower jaw (which all Mammalia have, and only Mammalia have) is the key feature that would make us \"One-bone-in-jaw-malia.\" There's more here than nature.</p>\n\n<p>So: we make sense of our place in the universe by classifying; our classifications are not necessarily derived from nature; and even when they are derived from nature, they encode cultural information.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if there isn't a natural classification for the things we're interested in, we often come up with one anyway. For example, time is continuous, but we divide it into sixty-minute hours, twelve-hour days and nights, and seven-day weeks, with the days named after skygods. These are arbitrary conventions; we inherited these time divisions from the ancient Babylonians (Zerubavel, 1985).</p>\n\n<p>Here's the paradox. The classifications that are the most arbitrary, and the least natural, seem to be the ones that matter the most to us. People could be categorized in many ways. There are short people and tall people; people with straight teeth and crooked teeth; with wiry, muscular, or chunky body builds; with freckles; with more or less body hair. These are natural differences, but they're not very important to us.</p>\n\n<p>What is important? Whether you're an American or an Iraqi. Whether you're a Nazi, a Communist, a Democrat, or a Republican. An Oriole fan or a Yankee fan. Rich or poor. Us or them. These categories of history and of society, the categories of human invention, are far more important to our daily lives than the categories of natural variation in our species.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, people look different, but the people who hate each other the most are generally the people who are biologically the most similar --Irish and English, Hutu and Tutsi, Arab and Israeli, Huron and Iroquois; Bosnian, Croatian, and Serb. Group identifications and animosities, lives and life-and-death struggles, are rooted in cultural, social, political, and economic differences, not in biological differences. Biological difference can be recruited to reinforce them, because that makes human evil appear to be the result of nature, but nature is not at the root here.</p>\n\n<p>So returning to the issue of race, how old is the idea that there are, say, four kinds of people, each localized to a continent? The answer is that the first person to suggest it was a Frenchman named François Bernier in 1684.</p>\n\n<p>The ancient Egyptians and Greeks had recognized that people from different places looked different, that the Egyptians were more darkly complected than the Greeks, and less darkly complected than the Nubians, and all of them were lighter than the Scythians. Of course in those days, long travel was done over land, where the physical differences between neighboring peoples were more subtle and gradual.</p>\n\n<p>But by the end of the seventeenth century, most of the world had been visited by Europeans. Their typical mode of travel was by boat - you boarded in one place where the people looked a certain way, and several weeks later you got off at a port where the people looked quite different, for example in West Africa and East Asia (Brace 1995).</p>\n\n<p>It was our friend Linnaeus, once again, who in 1758 scientifically formalized the distinction among the continental populations of the world. The order Primates (a term Linnaeus coined) subsumed several genera, of which our genus Homo was one. Homo (Linnaeus thought) subsumed two species, Homo sapiens (us) and Homo nocturnus (incorporating the more anthropomorphic descriptions of the chimpanzee). So how many subspecies did the species Homo sapiens subsume?</p>\n\n<p>Linnaeus decided there were five subspecies of our species. One was Homo sapiens monstrosus, which included people with birth defects, and the other four were geographic. Those were white Europeans, yellow Asians, red Americans, and black Africans.</p>\n\n<p>Linnaeus maintained that he was simply doing to humans what he did to any other species, being scientific and objective in his categorizations. But if you read the characteristics he used to differentiate the geographic subspecies, you see that they're ridiculous over-generalizations, frequently outright slanders, and usually not even biological attributes at all.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, for example, Homo sapiens americanus is red, ill-tempered, and impassive. After a terse description of looks and personality of each group, Linnaeus proceeds to describe their dress and government. Americans paint themselves, Europeans wear tight-fitting clothes, Asians wear loose-fitting clothes, and Africans anoint themselves with grease.</p>\n\n<p>Now, it's easy to bash scientists from 250 years ago. The point I'm trying to make, however, is that this is very specifically the origin of the idea that there is a scientific and authoritative way to categorize people into four distinct groups (Hudson, 1996).</p>\n\n<p>The generation of scholars immediately after Linnaeus jettisoned the use of clothing as taxonomic criterion. But it's not until the middle of the present century that anthropologists began to question the empirical basis for generalizing continentally about the human species (Montagu, 1941). We now recognize that these are neither the discrete fundamental units of our species, nor are they even comparable biological subdivisions.</p>\n\n<p>The human species simply doesn't come packaged into something like zoological subspecies. Rather, what we find are local populations that are similar to other populations nearby and different from populations far away. This variation no more tells us there are four kinds of people than it tells us there are five or six or twelve or thirty-seven kinds of people (Montagu, 1963; Livingstone, 1962; Marks, 1995).</p>\n\n<p>If we focus on the people from the most geographically divergent places of the earth - say, Norway, Nigeria, and Vietnam - of course they look different. But what does that difference represent? There is no reason to think it represents primordial purity, as if once upon a time there were people living only in Oslo, Lagos, and Saigon. There have always been, as far as we know, people living in the rest of the Old World.</p>\n\n<p>Consider, for example, the people of South Asia - India and Pakistan. Many of them are darkly pigmented like Africans and have facial features similar to Europeans, yet they live on the continent of Asia. What do you do with these people? And if you put them in a separate group, then what about all the other people who look distinctive - Polynesians, New Guineans, Australians, North Africans?</p>\n\n<p>Our ideas about the small number of basic human groups have been shaped largely by accidents of European history - the ports of call for the merchant fleet - and by patterns of immigration into the United States. Immigrants to the United States have come disproportionately from the regions surrounding those ports of call.</p>\n\n<p>Africans are incredibly heterogeneous. When we think of Africans we often think of West Africans. But remember you have the tallest people in the world in parts of Kenya and the Sudan, and the shortest people in the world in parts of the Congo and the Central African Republic. The people of East Africa look different from the people of West Africa; the people of southern Africa look different too. There are populations of very variable facial features and skin tones.</p>\n\n<p>Why group them all together and distinguish them from Europeans and Asians? Answer: because it's a difference we want to emphasize for political reasons. Of course, when you do that, you create a classic empirical problem at the boundaries. Let's say you juxtapose a Negroid African race against a Euro-Mediterranean Caucasoid race, as anthropologists used to do. Here's the simple fallacy: it works for the Swedes and the Senegalese, but what about the Ethiopians and Iranians?</p>\n\n<p>Any way you compare them - physically, genetically - the African Ethiopians are more similar to the \"Caucasoid\" Iranians than they are to the people of Senegal. Why? Simple: they are closer geographically. Likewise, Iranians are more similar to Ethiopians than they are to Swedes. So how can you objectively put a boundary line between them and decide they're in different groups. Such a division is just not biologically true.</p>\n\n<p>Humans vary gradually in nature, yet for cultural reasons we partition them into races (just as we divide time, which is continuous, into discrete units of minutes, hours, and weeks).</p>\n\n<p>Race is intended to denote discrete basic subdivisions of the human species, equivalent to a subspecies of mice, within which there is little variability and among which there are discrete differences. These subdivisions do not exist objectively in the human species. Why? Two reasons: First, populations are adapted to the places they live. Since geography and climatic conditions vary gradually and continuously, so do the human populations occupying these spaces. And second, what Cole Porter called \"the urge to merge\" has its effect. That is, human populations interbreed with their neighbors: population A with population B, B with C, C with D. And of course, sometimes A with C or D - that is, with people from further away. All human populations have histories - they trade. None of them has been sitting isolated and untouched since the Pleistocene (and the failure to appreciate that, by the way, is one of the last great ethnocentrisms in modern science).</p>\n\n<p>This is why anthropologists no longer talk about races; we talk about populations. We talk about local, fluid, biocultural units. Those are what are out there in nature, as far as we can tell.</p>\n\n<p>Now, because what we have are fluid, biocultural, historical populations, not discrete subspecies, we run into a problem when we superimpose our preconceptions about heredity on genetic data. Let's imagine that Mom and Dad have a baby girl. For some reason Baby Girl either wants to, or has to, prove her racial identity. The ultimate arbiter of hereditary issues is science, the science of genetics. Mom and Dad look racially appropriate as does Baby Girl, but for some reason that's not enough. So Baby Girl is subjected to a genetic test to look for a specific genetic marker that her race has and that others don't.</p>\n\n<p>If we take her family back two more generations, we know she has four grandparents and eight great-grandparents. Did all eight have that genetic marker? Because if one of them didn't have it, there is a small but significant chance that Baby Girl inherited that racially \"wrong\" genetic marker. And that's precisely the problem. If one great-grandma was different - either she was from somewhere else, or she just inherited a different marker from one of her ancestors, or the genetic generalization was incorrect - then the \"wrong\" marker has a fifty-fifty chance of being passed on each generation.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, you could have a child who looks just like you and your spouse, but fails a genetic test to match her to your racial category on account of one great-grandparent (who may have been just as racially \"correct\" as the other seven). That's why you can't do a genetic test for race. Race and genetics don't map on to one another particularly well.</p>\n\n<p>This parallels, of course, the old miscegenation laws, which prohibited marriage between blacks and whites. If you're going to prohibit intermarriage, you have to define precisely who is black and who is white. The classic definition came to be known as the \"one drop of blood rule\" - any non-white ancestry made you non-white. In practice, one black great-grandparent defined you as legally black; seven white great-grandparents weren't enough to make you white (Wright, 1996; Pascoe, 1996).</p>\n\n<p>The technology is different today, but the cultural mind-set is the same. The problem is simple and anthropological. Race is inherited, but in a different fashion from biological heredity. Race is inherited according to no scientific laws, but rather by a commonsense or folk cultural system.</p>\n\n<p>Like the way we name our relatives, racial divisions are not determined by biology, and they don't map very well onto genetic relationships. In fact, races are simply named groups, nothing more. Naming is what confers meaning, and this is wonderfully illustrated by a photomontage from Newsweek a couple of years ago. They asked \"What Color Is Black?\" and showed that the category \"black people\" subsumes people who look very different. And that's precisely the point. A genetic test for \"black\" would be failed by half the people on that page of photographs (and not necessarily the lightest complected half either), and would even be failed by half the inhabitants of Africa. On the other hand, many non-Africans would \"pass\" the test.</p>\n\n<p>The key thing is to appreciate that race and genetics aren't from the same worlds. So it's not that one is good and the other is bad. It's that one is scientific, and the other provides a means of localizing yourself and others in a very subjective world of social relations. The difficulty comes when we confuse them for one another. It's not that race doesn't exist, an idea I occasionally see espoused in the newspaper; it's that race doesn't exist as a \"biological entity.\" It certainly exists as a symbolic, social category. That actually makes it culturally more real and more important than if it were biological.</p>\n\n<p>Race is not a category derived from genetics. But our folk views are very deep rooted. For example, I can see the sun rise, traverse a path across the heavens, and set over the opposite horizon; yet we now know, of course, that the sun doesn't go around the earth. It's an optical illusion. To a large extent the growth of science involves overturning those commonsense ideas and showing them to be better explained in other ways that aren't immediately apparent.</p>\n\n<p>There are four major categories of folk ideologies of heredity. The first is the one we've already discussed - the existence of human subspecies or \"taxonomism.\" The second is \"racism,\" the belief that a person is simply the embodiment of the group, and thereby possesses whatever attributes are assigned to the group. It's a folk theory of heredity because it confers innate properties upon people based just on membership, rather than through observation of what the person is really like.</p>\n\n<p>There is another component to this fallacy, and that is the relationship between what people don't do and what they can't do. The Bell Curve (Herrnstein and Murray 1994) argued from test scores to what the authors called \"cognitive ability\". In fact, however, we can't study abilities, we can only study performances; and the relationship between them contains an important asymmetry - ability is only one component of the performance you observe. Good performance implies abilities; but poor performance does not imply the lack of abilities. The very concept of ability - something endowed at birth, yet perceptible only after it's been developed - is not scientific, not genetic, not empirical, and exists as simply folk wisdom (Marks 1997).</p>\n\n<p>Third is \"hereditarianism,\" the idea that you are whatever is in your cells, that \"blood will tell\" because \"like begets like\". This idea goes back a long way in human history. The royal family is treated better than the average Londoner for that very reason. This mode of thought, obviously, has provided a justification for hereditary aristocracies for millennia.</p>\n\n<p>We see it in high-tech forms now, in the idea that genes, rather than blood, will tell. The problem here is that we know very little about the development of normal traits in people. Much of what we know comes from the study of pathology, and it's very tricky to infer normal function from the study of its breakdown. Imagine trying to figure out what the fuel injector in your car actually does by opening the hood, smashing it with a hammer, and observing the results. Since previously there was little coming out of your exhaust but now you see billows of black smoke, you might come to believe that you have isolated the \"smoke controller\". Well, of course, that's not what the fuel injector actually does - smoke emission is just a side effect of screwing it up.</p>\n\n<p>Let me give you a more concrete example. There is a rare disease called Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. It results from mutation of a gene located on the X chromosome that codes for the production of an enzyme called hypozanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT). The mutated gene cannot produce HGPRT, and without this enzyme you have Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Boys afflicted with this syndrome have an irresistible compulsion to flail and to bite. They end up biting their lips and fingers and require strong restraint.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the failure of this gene has a behavioral effect - a terrible, horrible effect. But what does this tell us about normal people who self-mutilate? What does it tell us about nail-biters like me? Or rituals of scarification? Or punks with pierced body parts? Or teenage girls with low self-image, who cut themselves? Absolutely nothing. The vast majority of self-mutilating behavior in our species occurs in people who don't have Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, people who are genetically normal. The gene for a bizarre pathological behavior tells us virtually nothing about the general occurrence of the behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, a geneticist can be quoted making precisely that connection in Scientific American (Beardsley 1995). It is actually a non-sequitur; an inference from folk heredity. And now we learn that social graces are controlled by a gene on the X-chromosome, based on a study of girls with Turner's syndrome (Angier 1997).</p>\n\n<p>The last major component of modern folk heredity is \"essentialism,\" the idea that we have to ignore apparent differences to find an invisible underlying uniformity. That is the basis for thinking there might be a genetic test for race, as we discussed earlier.</p>\n\n<p>In a recent study (Skorecki et al. 1997), it was determined that 54 percent of self-designated Hebrew priests, many of whom have the surname Cohen, had the same configuration of two genes on the Y-chromosome; as opposed to only 33% of Jews who did not think they were priests. On this basis the authors inferred that this one was the real genetic constitution of the Jewish priestly line inherited directly from biblical Aaron.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, often people with the same last names are going to be more closely related than people with different last names, reflecting recent common ancestry (known as isonymy). If you survey their Y chromosomes, you're going to find more homogeneity than you'd find in a random sample. Without a control group, to look at the Y chromosome in a sample of Horowitzes or Steinbergs for example, the inference that the one represented at 54 percent rather than 33 percent in Cohens is somehow distinguishing and authentic is dubious at best. But the result was reported in the New York Times nevertheless (Grady, 1997a, 1997b).</p>\n\n<p>More importantly, the authors of that report find themselves in the middle of an identity controversy; after all, people want to know authoritatively if they are \"really\" Hebrew priests or not. Of course, nobody's a Hebrew priest; there hasn't been a priesthood for centuries. Even so, these genetic data are invested with cultural authority, in spite of how shaky the inference is. The construction of identity is a political arena in which geneticists are uniquely unqualified to work. The failure to appreciate the responsibilities thus incurred contributed to the demise of the Human Genome Diversity Project (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1991; Mead, 1996).</p>\n\n<p>Let me conclude, then, with a diagnosis and a prescription. Genetics is a very important area of scientific research; we need it, and we need public understanding of it. But what is even more pressing is the need to understand the difference between scientific heredity (or genetics) and folk ideas on heredity. Geneticists should contribute to educating the public about these distinctions. There are three reasons why they haven't lived up to that responsibility. One, as cultural beings, geneticists have assimilated the same folk ideas as everyone else, and it is very hard to step out of their mind-set. Two, this is largely humanistic knowledge, outside the formal training of an average geneticist.</p>\n\n<p>The third reason is a bit more insidious. When geneticists tell you that genetics is the solution to social problems, personality problems, global problems, they may have a conflict of interest. In other words, sometimes geneticists are willing to exploit cultural ideas to justify scientific ones.</p>\n\n<p>To get the Human Genome Project off the ground, its first director, James Watson, told Time (Jaroff 1989), \"We used to think our fate was in the stars. Now we know, in large measure, our fate is in our genes.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now that, as Clarence Darrow used to say, would be interesting if true. But it raises a lot of questions. Do we have fates, in any significant sense of that term? Do we know they have been localized to our cellular nuclei? Is genetics really just hi-tech astrology, although presumably more accurate?</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that such a statement might be a true inference about nature, but obviously it's more than that. It's also a political statement about the immutability of one's place in the fabric of society. If we have fates and they are in our genes, then by implication the differences between a Harvard professor and an urban teenage gang member are explained by recourse to bands and blots and gels, and there would be little hope to change their life trajectories. Also, the statement encodes a political philosophy towards the social problems out there requiring solutions.</p>\n\n<p>To appreciate Watson's statement fully, you have to realize that it was also a grant proposal. It was made in the context of trying to raise 10 billion dollars of federal money to study genetics. Of course geneticists are going to tell you that what they study is the most important thing in your life. To the extent that folk ideologies about heredity reinforce the importance of genetics in the public eye, there's not much incentive to distinguish between them. It was true in the 1920s and it's true now.</p>\n\n<p>We face two questions. First, how do we get geneticists to distinguish between scientific and non-scientific ideas about heredity? (Because if they don't, the rest of us certainly can't be expected to.) And, second, how can we believe what geneticists say when they have an economic stake in the outcome of the research? It is the responsibility of the genetics community to confront these two problems, and it may require rethinking how geneticists are trained.</p>\n\n<p><br /><strong>References</strong></p>\n\n<p>Angier, N.

To address the issue of race and equality, we must consider color in several different, seemingly contrary ways. The first is to recognize race's illusory status to avoid recapitulating racial categories and racial divides. The second is to acknowledge the real effect those categories have had and continue to have on peoples' lives and circumstances. And the third is to understand that racial divides, by their very nature, create imbalance and inequality.<br /><br />\nThese various shades of \"color\" must all be kept in perspective, none at the expense of the other, if we want to address seriously the question of how to be an equitable society today. There may not be a solution, but if there is one, it will almost certainly be difficult, and it will require effort, awareness, and responsibility. We can not afford to be \"colorblind.\" We need to develop our ability to see \"color\" for what is, has been, and will be, so we're prepared to deal with its consequences.</p>"},"changed":1531438957}],"backref_field_t_node_clip":null}},{"name":"Intra-species variation","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Race Without Color (EXTERNAL ARTICLE EXAMPLE)","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"Racial classification didn't come from science but from the body's signals for differentiating attractive from unattractive sex partners, and for differentiating friend from foe."},"field_author":{"processed":"Jared Diamond"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":null}},{"title":"Ten Things Everyone Should Know About Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":true,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Our eyes tell us that people look different.

How does race affect people today?</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>There's less - and more - to race than meets the eye:</p>\n\n<p>1. Race is a modern idea. Ancient societies, like the Greeks, did not divide people according to physical distinctions, but according to religion, status, class, even language. The English language didn't even have the word 'race' until it turns up in 1508 in a poem by William Dunbar referring to a line of kings.</p>\n\n<p>2. Race has no genetic basis. Not one characteristic, trait or even gene distinguishes all the members of one so-called race from all the members of another so-called race.</p>\n\n<p>3. Human subspecies don't exist. Unlike many animals, modern humans simply haven't been around long enough or isolated enough to evolve into separate subspecies or races. Despite surface appearances, we are one of the most similar of all species.</p>\n\n<p>4. Skin color really is only skin deep. Most traits are inherited independently from one another. The genes influencing skin color have nothing to do with the genes influencing hair form, eye shape, blood type, musical talent, athletic ability or forms of intelligence. Knowing someone's skin color doesn't necessarily tell you anything else about him or her.</p>\n\n<p>5. Most variation is within, not between, \"races.\" Of the small amount of total human variation, 85% exists within any local population, be they Italians, Kurds, Koreans or Cherokees. About 94% can be found within any continent. That means two random Koreans may be as genetically different as a Korean and an Italian.</p>\n\n<p>6. Slavery predates race. Throughout much of human history, societies have enslaved others, often as a result of conquest or war, even debt, but not because of physical characteristics or a belief in natural inferiority. Due to a unique set of historical circumstances, ours was the first slave system where all the slaves shared similar physical characteristics.</p>\n\n<p>7. Race and freedom evolved together. The U.S. was founded on the radical new principle that \"All men are created equal.\" But our early economy was based largely on slavery. How could this anomaly be rationalized? The new idea of race helped explain why some people could be denied the rights and freedoms that others took for granted.</p>\n\n<p>8. Race justified social inequalities as natural. As the race idea evolved, white superiority became \"common sense\" in America. It justified not only slavery but also the extermination of Native peoples, exclusion of Asian immigrants, and the taking of Mexican lands by a nation that professed a belief in democracy. Racial practices were institutionalized within American government, laws, and society.</p>\n\n<p>9. Race isn't biological, but racism is still real. Race is a powerful social idea that gives people different access to opportunities and resources. Our government and social institutions have created advantages that disproportionately channel wealth, power, and resources to white people. This affects everyone, whether we are aware of it or not.</p>\n\n<p>10. Colorblindness will not end racism. Pretending race doesn't exist is not the same as creating equality. Race is more than stereotypes and individual prejudice. To combat racism, we need to identify and remedy social policies and institutional practices that advantage some groups at the expense of others.</p>\n\n<p><em>RACE - The Power of an Illusion was produced by California Newsreel in association with the Independent Television Service (ITVS).

But many peoples throughout history have been enslaved without the imposition of racial ideology. When we look at 17th century colonial America before the enactment of laws legitimizing slavery only for Africans and their descendants (after 1660), several facts become clear.</p>\n\n<p>1) The first people that the English tried to enslave and place on plantations were the Irish with whom they had had hostile relations since the 13th century.</p>\n\n<p>2) Some Englishmen had proposed laws enslaving the poor in England and in the colonies to force them to work indefinitely.</p>\n\n<p>3) Most of the slaves on English plantations in Barbados and Jamaica were Irish and Indians.</p>\n\n<p>4) Many historians point out that African servants and bonded indentured white servants were treated much the same way. They often joined together, as in the case of Bacon's Rebellion (1676) to oppose the strict and oppressive laws of the colonial government.</p>\n\n<p>In the latter part of the 17th century the demand for labor grew enormously. It had become clear that neither Irishmen nor Indians made good slaves. More than that, the real threats to social order were the poor freed whites who demanded lands and privileges that the upper class colonial governments refused. Some colonial leaders argued that turning to African labor provided a buffer against the masses of poor whites.</p>\n\n<p>Until the 18th century the image of Africans was generally positive. They were farmers and cattle-breeders; they had industries, arts and crafts, governments and commerce. In addition, Africans had immunities to Old World diseases. They were better laborers and they had nowhere to escape to once transplanted to the New World. The colonists themselves came to believe that they could not survive without Africans.</p>\n\n<p>When some Englishmen entered slave trading directly, it became clear that many of the English public had misgivings about slave-trading and re-creating slavery on English soil. It was an era when the ideals of equality, justice, democracy, and human rights were becoming dominant features of Western political philosophy. Those involved in the trade rationalized their actions by arguing that the Africans were heathens after all, and it was a Christian duty to save their souls. By the early part of the 18th century, the institution was fully established for Africans and their descendants. Large numbers of slaves flooded the southern colonies and even some northern ones. Sometimes they outnumbered whites, and the laws governing slavery became increasingly harsher.</p>\n\n<p><strong>A New Social Identity</strong></p>\n\n<p>Toward the end of the eighteenth century, the image of Africans began to change dramatically. The major catalyst for this transformation was the rise of a powerful antislavery movement that expanded and strengthened during the Revolutionary Era both in Europe and in the United States. As a consequence proslavery forces found it necessary to develop new arguments for defending the institution. Focusing on physical differences, they turned to the notion of the natural inferiority of Africans and thus their God-given suitability for slavery. Such arguments became more frequent and strident from the end of the eighteenth century on, and the characterizations of Africans became more negative.</p>\n\n<p>From here we see the structuring of the ideological components of \"race.\" The term \"race,\" which had been a classificatory term like \"type,\" or \"kind,\" but with ambiguous meaning, became more widely used in the eighteenth century, and crystallized into a distinct reference for Africans, Indians and Europeans. By focusing on the physical and status differences between the conquered and enslaved peoples, and Europeans, the emerging ideology linked the socio-political status and physical traits together and created a new form of social identity. Proslavery leaders among the colonists formulated a new ideology that merged all Europeans together, rich and poor, and fashioned a social system of ranked physically distinct groups. The model for \"race\" and \"races\" was the Great Chain of Being or Scale of Nature (Scala Naturae), a semi-scientific theory of a natural hierarchy of all living things, derived from classical Greek writings. The physical features of different groups became markers or symbols of their status on this scale, and thus justified their positions within the social system. Race ideology proclaimed that the social, spiritual, moral, and intellectual inequality of different groups was, like their physical traits, natural, innate, inherited, and unalterable.</p>\n\n<p>Thus was created the only slave system in the world that became exclusively \"racial.\" By limiting perpetual servitude to Africans and their descendants, colonists were proclaiming that blacks would forever be at the bottom of the social hierarchy. By keeping blacks, Indians and whites socially and spatially separated and enforcing endogamous mating, they were making sure that visible physical differences would be preserved as the premier insignia of unequal social statuses. From its inception separateness and inequality was what \"race\" was all about. The attributes of inferior race status came to be applied to free blacks as well as slaves. In this way, \"race\" was configured as an autonomous new mechanism of social differentiation that transcended the slave condition and persisted as a form of social identity long after slavery ended.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Humans as Property</strong></p>\n\n<p>American slavery was unique in another way; that is, how North American slave-owners resolved the age-old dilemma of all slave systems. Slaves are both persons and things--human beings and property. How do you treat a human being as both person and property? And what should take precedence, the human rights of the slave or the property rights of the master? American laws made clear that property was more sacred than people, and the property rights of masters overshadowed the human rights of slaves. Said Chief Justice Roger B. Taney in the famous Dred Scott case of 1857, \"Negroes were seen only as property; they were never thought of or spoken of except as property\" and \"(thus) were not intended by the framers of the Constitution to be accorded citizenship rights.\"</p>\n\n<p>In order to transform people solely into property, you must minimize those qualities that make them human. Literature of the early nineteenth century began to portray \"the negro\" as a savage in even stronger terms than those that had been used for the Irish two centuries earlier. This was a major transformation in thought about who Africans were. Historian George Fredrickson states explicitly that \"before 1830 open assertions of permanent black inferiority were exceedingly rare\" (The Black Image in the White Mind, 1987). By mid-century, the ideology of \"negro inferiority\" dominated both popular and scholarly thought.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Science and the Justification for \"Races\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>What is so striking about the American experience in creating such an extreme conception of human differences was the role played by scientists and scholars in legitimizing the folk ideas. Scholarly writers began attempting to prove scientifically that \"the Negro\" was a different and lower kind of human being. The first published materials arguing from a scientific perspective that \"negroes\" were a separate species from white men appeared in the last decade of the eighteenth century. They argued that Negroes were either a product of degeneration from that first creation, or descendants of a separate creation altogether.</p>\n\n<p>American intellectuals appropriated, and rigidified, the categories of human groups established by European scholars during the eighteenth century, but ignored Blumenbach's caution that human groups blend insensibly into one another, so that it is impossible to place precise boundaries around them.</p>\n\n<p>When Dr. Samuel Morton in the 1830s initiated the field of craniometry, the first school of American anthropology, proponents of race ideology received the most powerful scientific support yet. Measuring the insides of crania collected from many populations, he offered \"evidence\" that the Negro had a smaller brain than whites, with Indians in-between. Morton is also famous for his involvement in a major scientific controversy over creation.</p>\n\n<p>The very existence of a scientific debate over whether blacks and whites were products of a single creation, or of multiple creations, especially in a society dominated by Biblical explanations, seems anomalous. It indicates that the differences between \"races\" had been so magnified and exaggerated that popular consciousness had already widely accepted the idea of blacks being a different and inferior species of humans. Justice Taney's decision reflected this, declaring, \"the negro is a different order of being.\" Thus slave-owners' rights to their \"property\" were upheld in law by appeal to the newly invented identity of peoples from Africa.</p>\n\n<p>Scientists collaborated in confirming popular beliefs, and publications appeared on a regular basis providing the \"proof\" that comforted the white public. That some social leaders were conscious of their role in giving credibility to the invented myths is manifest in statements such as that found in the Charleston Medical Journal after Dr. Morton's death. It states, \"We can only say that we of the South should consider him as our benefactor, for aiding most materially in giving to the negro his true position as an inferior race\". George Gliddon, co-editor of a famous scientific book Types of Mankind, (1854) which argued that Negroes were closer to apes than to humans and ranked all other groups between whites and Negroes, sent a copy of the book to a famous southern politician, saying that he was sure the south would appreciate the powerful support that this book gave for its \"peculiar institution\" (slavery). Like another famous tome (The Bell Curve, 1995) this was an 800-page book whose first edition sold out immediately; it went through nine other editions before the end of the century. What it said about the inferiority of blacks became widely known, even by those who could not read it.</p>\n\n<p>During discussions in the U.S. Senate on the future of \"the negro\" after slavery, James Henry Hammond proclaimed in 1858 \"somebody has to be the mudsills of society, to do the menial duties, to perform the drudgery of life.\" Negroes were destined to be the mudsills. This was to be their place, one consciously created for them by a society whose cultural values now made it impossible to assimilate them. In the many decades since the Civil War, white society made giant strides to \"keep the negro in his place.\" Public policies and the customs and practices of millions of Americans expressed this racial worldview throughout the twentieth century.</p>\n\n<p>These are some of the circumstances surrounding the origin of the racial worldview in North America. Race ideology was a mechanism justifying what had already been established as unequal social groups; it was from its inception, and is today, about who should have access to privilege, power, status, and wealth, and who should not. As a useful political ideology for conquerors, it spread into colonial situations around the world. It was promulgated in the latter half of the 19th century by some Europeans against other Europeans and reached its most extreme development in the twentieth century Nazi holocaust.</p>\n\n<p>All anthropologists should understand that \"race\" has no intrinsic relationship to human biological diversity, that such diversity is a natural product of primarily evolutionary forces while \"race\" is a social invention.</p>"}},{"__typename":"node__article","id":"4d190c01-d90d-4e52-aa8a-150cf47432df","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>An ideological basis for explicit racism came to a unique fruition in the West during the modern period.</p>"},"field_old_article_discl":{"processed":"<p>NOTE: This article was originally published in 2004, and is included here for reference.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"George M.

An ideological basis for explicit racism came to a unique fruition in the West during the modern period. No clear and unequivocal evidence of racism has been found in other cultures or in Europe before the Middle Ages. The identification of the Jews with the devil and witchcraft in the popular mind of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was perhaps the first sign of a racist view of the world. Official sanction for such attitudes came in sixteenth century Spain when Jews who had converted to Christianity and their descendants became the victims of a pattern of discrimination and exclusion.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>The period of the Renaissance and Reformation was also the time when Europeans were coming into increasing contact with people of darker pigmentation in Africa, Asia, and the Americas and were making judgments about them. The official rationale for enslaving Africans was that they were heathens, but slave traders and slave owners sometimes interpreted a passage in the book of Genesis as their justification. Ham, they maintained, committed a sin against his father Noah that condemned his supposedly black descendants to be \"servants unto servants.\" When Virginia decreed in 1667 that converted slaves could be kept in bondage, not because they were actual heathens but because they had heathen ancestry, the justification for black servitude was thus changed from religious status to something approaching race. Beginning in the late seventeenth century laws were also passed in English North America forbidding marriage between whites and blacks and discriminating against the mixed offspring of informal liaisons. Without clearly saying so, such laws implied that blacks were unalterably alien and inferior.</p>\n\n<p>During the Enlightenment, a secular or scientific theory of race moved the subject away from the Bible, with its insistence on the essential unity of the human race. Eighteenth century ethnologists began to think of human beings as part of the natural world and subdivided them into three to five races, usually considered as varieties of a single human species. In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, however, an increasing number of writers, especially those committed to the defense of slavery, maintained that the races constituted separate species. </p>\n\n<p>The Nineteenth century was an age of emancipation, nationalism, and imperialism--all of which contributed to the growth and intensification of ideological racism in Europe and the United States. Although the emancipation of blacks from slavery and Jews from the ghettos received most of its support from religious or secular believers in an essential human equality, the consequence of these reforms was to intensify rather than diminish racism. Race relations became less paternalistic and more competitive. The insecurities of a burgeoning industrial capitalism created a need for scapegoats. The Darwinian emphasis on \"the struggle for existence\" and concern for \"the survival of the fittest\" was conducive to the development of a new and more credible scientific racism in an era that increasingly viewed race relations as an arena for conflict rather than as a stable hierarchy. </p>\n\n<p>The growth of nationalism, especially romantic cultural nationalism, encouraged the growth of a culture-coded variant of racist thought, especially in Germany. Beginning in the late 1870s and early 1880s, the coiners of the term \"antisemitism\" made explicit what some cultural nationalists had previously implied--that to be Jewish in Germany was not simply to adhere to a set of religious beliefs or cultural practices but meant belonging to a race that was the antithesis of the race to which true Germans belonged.</p>\n\n<p>The climax of Western imperialism in the late nineteenth century \"scramble for Africa\" and parts of Asia and the Pacific represented an assertion of the competitive ethnic nationalism that existed among European nations (and which, as a result of the Spanish-American War came to include the United States). It also constituted a claim, allegedly based on science, that Europeans had the right to rule over Africans and Asians.</p>\n\n<p>The climax of the history of racism came in the twentieth century in the rise and fall of what might be called overtly racist regimes. In the American South, the passage of racial segregation laws and restrictions on black voting rights reduced African Americans to lower caste status. Extreme racist propaganda, which represented black males as ravening beasts lusting after white women, served to rationalize the practice of lynching. A key feature of the racist regime maintained by state law in the South was a fear of sexual contamination through rape or intermarriage, which led to efforts to prevent the conjugal union of whites with those with any known or discernable African ancestry. </p>\n\n<p>Racist ideology was eventually of course carried to its extreme in Nazi Germany. It took Hitler and his cohorts to attempt the extermination of an entire ethnic group on the basis of a racist ideology. Hitler, it has been said, gave racism a bad name. The moral revulsion of people throughout the world against what the Nazis did, reinforced by scientific studies undermining racist genetics (or eugenics), served to discredit the scientific racism that had been respectable and influential in the United States and Europe before the Second World War. </p>\n\n<p>Explicit racism also came under devastating attack from the new nations resulting from the decolonization of Africa and Asia and their representatives in the United Nations. The Civil Rights movement in the United States, which succeeded in outlawing legalized racial segregation and discrimination in the 1960s drew crucial support from the growing sense that national interests were threatened when blacks in the United States were mistreated and abused. In the competition with the Soviet Union for \"the hearts and minds\" of independent Africans and Asians, Jim Crow and the ideology that sustained it became a national embarrassment with possible strategic consequences.</p>\n\n<p>The one racist regime that survived the Second World War and the Cold War was the South African in 1948. The laws passed banning all marriage and sexual relations between different \"population groups\" and requiring separate residential areas for people of mixed race (\"Coloreds\"), as well as for Africans, signified the same obsession with \"race purity\" that characterized the other racist regimes. However the climate of world opinion in the wake of the Holocaust induced apologists for apartheid to avoid, for the most part, straightforward biological racism and rest their case for \"separate development\" mainly on cultural rather than physical differences. </p>\n\n<p>The defeat of Nazi Germany, the desegregation of the American South in the 1960s, and the establishment of majority rule in South Africa suggest that regimes based on biological racism or its cultural essentialist equivalent are a thing of the past. But racism does not require the full and explicit support of the state and the law. Nor does it require an ideology centered on the concept of biological inequality. Discrimination by institutions and individuals against those perceived as racially different can long persist and even flourish under the illusion of non-racism, as historians of Brazil have recently discovered. The use of allegedly deep-seated cultural differences as a justification for hostility and discrimination against newcomers from the Third World in several European countries has led to allegations of a new \"cultural racism.\" Recent examples of a functionally racist cultural determinism are not in fact unprecedented. They rather represent a reversion to the way that the differences between groups could be made to seem indelible and unbridgeable before the articulation of a scientific or naturalistic conception of race in the eighteenth century.</p>"}},{"__typename":"node__article","id":"89c9292b-9ae0-4613-b2c0-7e0830a80f69","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Since the Civil Rights era, we are faced with the conundrum of having arbitrary racial categories which nevertheless reflect real social experiences and are necessary to track and remedy discrimination.</p>"},"field_old_article_discl":{"processed":"<p>NOTE: This article was originally published in 2004, and is included here for reference.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"California Newsreel"},"field_author_bio":null,"field_copyright":{"processed":"<p>© 2003 California Newsreel.

The word \"slave\" in fact comes from \"Slav\": prisoners of Slavonic tribes captured by Germans and sold to Arabs during the Middle Ages. Prior to the Enlightenment, slavery was simply a fact of life, unquestioned. Race, on the other hand, is a much more recent idea, tied up with the founding of the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>In colonial America, our early economy was based largely on slavery. When the new concept of freedom was introduced during the American Revolution, it created a moral contradiction: how could a nation that proclaimed equality and the natural rights of man hold slaves? The idea of race helped resolve the contradiction by setting Africans apart. The notion of natural Black inferiority helped our founding fathers justify denying slaves the rights and entitlements that others took for granted.</p>\n\n<p>Later, as the abolitionist movement gained popularity and attacks on slavery grew, so did arguments in its defense. Slavery was no longer explained as a necessary evil, but justified as a positive good. The rationale for slavery was so strong that after emancipation, ideas of innate inferiority and superiority not only persisted but were intensified.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Were Africans enslaved because they were thought to be inferior?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In colonial America, Africans weren't enslaved because they were thought to be inferior. On the contrary, they were valued for their skill as farmers and desired for their labor. Planters had previously tried enslaving Native Americans, but many escaped and hid among neighboring tribes or were stricken by diseases brought to the New World by Europeans. </p>\n\n<p>In the early years of the colonies, the majority of workers were poor indentured servants from England. In fact, during Virginia's first century, 100,000 of the 130,000 Englishmen who crossed the Atlantic were indentured servants. Conditions of servitude were miserable, and nearly two-thirds died before their term of indenture ended. After several decades, African slaves began arriving in the U.S. and worked side by side with indentured servants. Many played together, intermarried, and ran away together. Racial categories were fluid, and slavery was not yet codified into law.</p>\n\n<p>In the mid-17th century, a crisis arose in the colonies. As economic conditions in Mother England improved, the number of volunteers willing to journey across the Atlantic to endure such harsh treatment dropped dramatically, causing a labor shortage. At the same time, tension and hostilities were mounting domestically, as more servants were surviving their indenture and demanding land from the planter elite. The entire plantation labor system and colonial social hierarchy was threatened; the situation came to a head when poor servants and slaves allied and attacked the elite classes during Bacon's Rebellion.</p>\n\n<p>After the system of indentured servitude proved unstable, planters turned increasingly to African slavery and began writing laws to divide Blacks from whites. Coincidentally, African slaves became more available at this time. Poor whites were given new entitlements and opportunities, including as overseers to police the slave population. Over time, they began to identify more with wealthy whites, and the degradation of slavery became identified more and more with Blackness.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How was the racial idea expanded to include other groups?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Imbued with a new validity by scientists, race evolved into the \"common-sense\" wisdom of white America by the middle of the 19th century. It was invoked not only to justify the enslavement of Africans, but also the taking of Mexican and Indian lands, the exclusion of Asian immigrants, and eventually, the acquisition of overseas territories such as the Philippine Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico. Racial superiority was seen not only as \"natural\" and inevitable but a moral responsibility for whites. The notions of Manifest Destiny and the White Man's Burden best capture this ideology of \"civilization\" and racial difference.</p>\n\n<p>Ideas of racial inferiority have been institutionalized - both explicitly and implicitly - within our laws, government, and public policies. Not surprisingly, racial definitions have also changed over time, depending on the political context. They have also been arbitrary and inconsistent from group to group.</p>\n\n<p>Mexicans, for example, were classified as white until 1930, when nativists lobbied successfully for them to be classified separately in order to target them for discrimination and emphasize their distinctness from whites. Historically, African Americans in the Jim Crow South were classified according to \"blood\" ancestry, but the amount (one quarter, one-sixteenth, one drop) varied from state to state, which meant that, as historian James Horton points out, \"you could cross a state line and literally, legally change race.\"</p>\n\n<p>Since the 19th century, Native Americans have been defined in terms opposite those defining African Americans. Rather than the \"one-drop\" rule, a minimum \"blood quantum\" requirement has been the standard for tribal membership and racial classification. Historically, membership in many Native American tribes was based on acceptance of tribal language, customs, and authority, not \"blood\" degree. Escaped slaves, whites and other Indians were able to join tribes and be accepted as full members. However, in the 1930s, tribes wanting federal recognition were forced to follow government guidelines, including membership based upon \"blood\" degree. A 1991 Bureau of Indian Affairs inventory of 155 federally recognized tribes in 48 states showed that 4 out of 5 condition membership on proof of blood, ranging in amount from 1/2 to 1/64th. </p>\n\n<p>Since the Civil Rights era, we are faced with the conundrum of having arbitrary racial categories which nevertheless reflect real social experiences and are necessary to track and remedy discrimination. As we grapple with what to do about race, it's useful to understand the historical circumstances and historical meanings surrounding the concept.</p>"}},{"__typename":"node__article","id":"ffc8b62c-c01a-41e9-b962-096dbf67a7a9","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>The census has always reflected and helped shape social divisions.</p>"},"field_old_article_discl":{"processed":"<p>This article was originally published in 2004, and is included here for reference.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Jean Cheng"},"field_author_bio":{"processed":"<p>Jean Cheng is the series co-producer for <em>RACE - The Power of an Illusion</em> and a former staff member of California Newsreel.</p>"},"field_copyright":{"processed":"<p>©2003 California Newsreel.

It was tied to important political questions - how much tax each state would owe, how many Congressional representatives they would have - and race played a key role in answering these questions. The first official census took place in 1790, the same year that Congress passed the first Naturalization Act (restricting the right of adopted citizenship to \"free white\" persons only).</p>\n\n<p>The census has always reflected and helped shape social divisions. Until 1850, only heads of households were counted. Slaves were listed on the census as numbers, not names, and Indians were not counted at all until the late 1800s. Between 1850 and 1870, 6.5 million Europeans entered as immigrants. During that same time, 60,000 Chinese entered. Despite the greater number of Europeans and the popular belief that Italians, Irish, Germans, English and Jews belonged to different races, only the Chinese were categorized separately, beginning in 1870, followed by other Asian groups in the early 1900s. Mixed race categories for blacks were also recorded during this time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Historically, being counted as a separate group was not a matter of choice or preference, but a way to target that group for discrimination or restrictions. Laws regulating Native Americans, African Americans, and Asians were passed around the time that certain census categories were introduced: for example, the 1883 Dawes Act, Jim Crow segregation laws, and the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, along with many other local and state laws restricting housing, marriage and jobs.</p>\n\n<p>Census classification also helped fuel racist science. At the turn of the century, census \"enumerators\" were instructed to be especially careful when counting Native Americans and blacks of mixed ancestry, because \"important scientific results\" depended on the result. Racial classification, however, was determined in a very unscientific way - according to the opinion of the enumerator, who based his conclusion on appearance alone. (Self-identification was not allowed until 1970.) Eugenicists, who believed in selective breeding and preserving the purity of the white race, used census results to lobby for social policies restricting groups' rights.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes the census played a very direct role in social policy. The 1924 Johnson-Reed Act, which limited immigration from Europe and Asia, was tied directly to the census numbers of 1890. The Census Bureau also contributed directly to the internment of Japanese Americans beginning in 1941, by providing a special hand tabulation of names and addresses for Japanese living on the West Coast.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Changing Roles</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since the civil rights movement, the Census has reversed its role - rather than counting in order to exclude, census numbers help us measure who is being excluded and what we are doing about it. This is because the laws have changed, since passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and other laws to address inequality. In fact, Directive 15, issued in 1977, which outlines the federal government's definitions of race, was created specifically to help determine whether Hispanic students were being denied educational opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Since the 1960s, individuals have also become more involved in defining how they are categorized. Not only is self-identification the new norm, but groups now lobby to be categorized in specific ways. Although the census has always been a political tool, it is now more explicit because groups recognize its power. In 1980, the first pan-ethnic umbrella categories, Asian Pacific Islander and American Native, were introduced. Although these lumped together people from different countries who speak different languages, the categories were created to reflect a common experience of discrimination here in the U.S. In 1997, the Asian Pacific Islander umbrella category was split in two - \"Asian\" and \"Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander\" - in order to address the different needs and concerns of the members of these groups.</p>\n\n<p>In recent years, there has also been a move to eliminate racial classification altogether and to allow individuals to acknowledge more than one race. Traditional civil rights groups have resisted this, because they fear a loss of support for programs that track discrimination and help remedy inequality.</p>\n\n<p>The role of the census will always reflect and define not just how we view ourselves, but where we place our political priorities.</p>"}}],"clips":[{"__typename":"node__clip","id":"8e8fd045-989c-4c9b-99ab-833ee6d2a055","field_episode":1,"title":"The biology becomes an excuse for social differences.","field_external_video_url":{"uri":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/280780091","title":""},"field_title_of_clip":{"processed":"Naturalizing Social Differences"},"relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"be792eba-e162-4441-abb6-f7c943962a6d","name":"Science: Pseudoscience","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"8661596c-176b-4527-97c4-af0e614da9d8","name":"Science and Pseudoscience"}]}},{"id":"8bd2ab46-3dab-4d28-8d25-67ebff32d455","name":"Racial Classifiation: Changing Categories","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4433de45-87b1-4a89-8fd4-378fb8776c55","name":"Racial Classification: Who Decides?"}]}}],"field_re":null,"field_poster_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/ec0a5910997552dd9ad13c38c7ae6be7-15385a77218f8bd798c93b3523b68cd0.png","childImageSharp":{"id":"c692ab6d-2683-5b49-ab6a-5e3293a9dae1 >> ImageSharp","original":{"width":1467,"height":858,"src":"/static/ec0a5910997552dd9ad13c38c7ae6be7-15385a77218f8bd798c93b3523b68cd0.png"},"sizes":{"src":"/static/ec0a5910997552dd9ad13c38c7ae6be7-15385a77218f8bd798c93b3523b68cd0-2fd78.png"},"resolutions":{"height":234,"width":400,"src":"/static/ec0a5910997552dd9ad13c38c7ae6be7-15385a77218f8bd798c93b3523b68cd0-37095.png"}}}}}},{"__typename":"node__clip","id":"130bcf49-8024-413d-b228-bd4667b0b989","field_episode":3,"title":"The melting pot never included people of color.

And I think asking people to define races is a good exercise to go through because then you see all the myriad of things that people pour into it. But I happen to think that color still remains one of the main ways by which people decide what race someone belongs to.</p>\n\n<p>So I think what we then do is this color also links to what we think of as cultural differences associated with race, and that is intellectual capacity, behavioral characteristics, values, perhaps even religion, fluency in particular languages. All these kinds of things are signaled somewhat in terms of a range of color. So I think color is such a primary thing. But if you ask two people on the street they're going to tell you two different answers about where to group somebody in terms of race.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the idea that there is some fundamental biological differences between human groups that this concept of race captures, I think, is still quite salient.</p>\n\n<p>So for me, it's the ways in which we have this sort of intense interest in difference. At the same time, we don't focus as much on similarities and we don't focus as much on our connections - for reasons that people might say have to do with power and privilege.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How have conventional scientific ideas of race changed over time?</strong></p>\n\n<p>At the end of the 19th century, race is seen as a kind of integrated totality. The concept embodied biological characteristics, cultural, linguistic, psychological and moral characteristics. The concept is quite rich. It carries all these kinds of connotations, and it's used similarly by the average person and by scientists. So there's not a gap between what the regular person on the street understands about race and what scientists or anthropologists or social scientists think about race at the end of the 19th century.</p>\n\n<p>But over the course of the 20th century, what's happened is, the experts have carefully, really in some respects, quite carefully tried to say, \"What are the biological aspects of this thing we call race? Is the thing we call race useful for what we want to understand about human variation?\" So over the course of the 20th century, with developments in genetics, biologists have come to particular conclusions about that notion of race as this sort of innate, immutable, fixed thing about human groups that conveys something about their bodies.</p>\n\n<p>And we've done that always. But one way in which we continue to kind of look for the source of that immutable difference is to probe deeper and deeper into the body. At this point, we're at the level of the gene. So the same kinds of questions are being asked but they're being asked in genetic terms.</p>\n\n<p>Here in the late 20th century or early 21st century, the way we talk about sort of innate, immutable, biological differences is to talk about them as genetic differences. And that's not necessarily the right way to talk about genetics at all. But I think in the popular press and in just general conversation, that's what people tend to do. And we do this in ways that again reflect the notion that there are some fundamental, immutable differences between human groups, especially racial groups.</p>\n\n<p>Biologists came to different conclusions about that than, say, social scientists who also have said, \"Look, the way we've used race certainly in the United States says a great deal about how we've organized our society, what kinds of people have been slaves, how different groups of people who have come to the United States at different periods of time have been treated based on the perception of biological, and cultural, and social differences.\"</p>\n\n<p>So for sociologists, for many philosophers, for other kinds of humanists race represents a social construct that talks about our history, it talks about the ways in which various peoples of darker skins have been oppressed and peoples of lighter skins have been privileged in every aspect of American life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How widespread was the 19th century attempt to measure \"difference\"?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Around the end of the Civil War period, the data that was collected on soldiers, particularly the Northern Army recruits, was analyzed by social scientists of the day. The people who did the measurements of these soldiers to determine whether or not they were fit to fight were largely physicians.</p>\n\n<p>And physicians came to this work with the sense that black people's bodies and white people's bodies were different. They had different responses to various diseases. They were susceptible to different kinds of diseases. They even thought that maybe the dimensions of the bodies were different, or they may have certain kinds of anatomical differences. And they wanted to, for the first time in this period, capture those differences in some kind of systematic way by actually measuring them and not depending simply upon observations. There had been some measurements of skulls, but there had not been so many measurements of entire bodies.</p>\n\n<p>The thing about looking for differences is once you look, you find them. So they find differences in sizes of chests, breadth of chests, length of limbs, capacity of lungs, these kinds of things. And, of course, they read those differences through the lens of race. So they read them to say that all African Americans can be categorized as having lesser lung capacity than all whites or whites of various ethnicities. So that's how they analyzed that data.</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, they categorize differences in susceptibility to disease, syphilis, tuberculosis, and all of these diseases, other kinds of infectious diseases. They also look at differences in susceptibility to pain. They look at physiological differences. They try to see differences in organs. You go from the outer body all the way in, as far in as you can possibly go, and the search for difference follows that. And this is what they do, they catalogue it.</p>\n\n<p>It just became clear as I read the texts that the physicians were among the peoples of color's worst enemies in the second half of the 19th century. From Maine to California, physicians were making observations about Black and Native Americans and Chinese bodies and temperaments and vitalities.</p>\n\n<p>And by the end of the 19th century, if we just take African Americans as an example, there's not a single body part that hasn't been subjected to this kind of analysis. So you'll find articles in the medical literature about the Negro ear, and the Negro nose, and the Negro leg, and the Negro heart, and the Negro eye, and the Negro foot, and it's every single body part. It is this endless catalogue of differences.</p>\n\n<p>Not only do they catalogue physical differences like the size and shape of organs, they're constantly looking for some organ that might be so fundamentally different in size and character that you can say this is something specific to the Negro versus that of whites and other groups. They don't find such things, but there are people who claim to have found such things.</p>\n\n<p>They look for differences. They expect to find differences. And almost any kind of difference is worth commentary. These are the perceptions that they brought with them, that there is some fundamental differences between African Americans, between Chinese, between Native Americans, and whites and those people they categorize as whites, that they will be able to see and find in the body.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why the obsession with difference?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I wouldn't necessarily characterize all of these people as racist, but I do think that the belief that there is some kind of fundamental differences between human groups that matter in their bodies, that determines their health or their illness is important to them because they are looking away from the kinds of social factors that impact health and illness and ability for people to work at their fullest capacities in the society that we were creating.</p>\n\n<p>Because looking at the societal structures is very difficult. Those that looked wanted to confirm what they saw, which is to say that the proper place of, say, the Negro, is at the bottom of our society. And they naturalized that position through their search for these fundamental physical and biological difference. So I think it's about a way of sort of naturalizing a social structure which everyone understood and clearly saw that the \"Negro\", or in other regions of the country, the Native American, or the Chinese were at the bottom of the social and political hierarchy. And if you can say that they are fundamentally and biologically different, then they should be. Then it's natural for them to be at the bottom of our social hierarchy. And it's only fitting because they're not naturally fit for a higher place.</p>\n\n<p>So drapetomania is a good example because it was the running away disease, something that would, of course, be only peculiar to those who have something to run away from, like slaves. So, instead of a physician talking about slavery as being something unnatural, drapetomania was a way of saying that the condition of slavery was natural for African Americans and to rebel against it then was a kind of abnormality, that was, in fact, tantamount to having a disease.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What can ovarian cysts tell us about ideas of racial difference?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The study of ovarian cysts at the turn of the century offers a good case to look at, in terms of the ways physicians talk about differences between African Americans and whites. So there were two articles published in 1899 and 1900. The first is by a white physician at Johns Hopkins and he says, \"Everyone knows that African American women don't get ovarian cysts.\" And the language he used would say, \"What I hold before you looks like an ovarian cyst. It has all the characteristics of an ovarian cyst, but it cannot be so because it came from the body of a Negress, and Negroes have not evolved to the cyst-bearing stage.\"</p>\n\n<p>So then he goes on in the article to describe the fact that this is what everyone believes, and we know this to be true. However, he had done a small study among patients in the hospital at Johns Hopkins and he had actually found a few cases of ovarian cysts in the African American women that he saw, but apparently not enough to dispel the overall view that these were quite rare in African American women.</p>\n\n<p>And following that, an African American physician, Daniel Hill Williams, ostensibly saw this article and responded quite vehemently to this by saying, \"You know, it is commonly asserted that Negresses do not have ovarian cysts, but I have studied hundreds of African American women; I've seen all kinds of cysts. And the reason that other people don't see them is in large measure because of this belief that Negro women do not have such cysts but also because of the great disparities in access to health care that these women experience on a daily basis.\"</p>\n\n<p>In other words, by the time they are seen with cysts, many of them have cysts that are so large, many of these women think that they were pregnant. They don't know what's going on with their bodies. And if they do, after the cysts have grown to be quite large, if they do have surgery they often die from the stresses of surgery at that particular point.</p>\n\n<p>But his main point was that this perception that Negroes had not evolved to the cyst bearing stage prevented physicians from dealing with their patients' actual conditions.</p>\n\n<p>The perception of difference is so deeply embedded that doctors then don't ask the kinds of questions that they should ask to determine whether or not what they see is something that's due to race and a racial difference or if it's due to a whole host of other factors. So the desire, I think, or at the very least the ways in which this notion of difference is so strong and still shakes perceptions is something that I see, certainly in cases from 1900, but you see it in cases up until the present as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who was Frederick Hoffman and what does his work signify?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Frederick Hoffman wrote, I think, one of the most influential documents in social science at the turn of the 20th century: Race, Traits, and Tendencies of the American Negro. And in this document, he put forth a whole host of statistics to back up the idea that the Negro would eventually become extinct. And he did this by charting disease rates, by looking at the conditions that the freed slaves faced in the cities as they moved away from the rural south and outside of slavery.</p>\n\n<p>A key measure for him was the differential rates of tuberculosis between whites and blacks. And what he found was that African Americans had very, very high rates of tuberculosis. He also found high rates of syphilis and venereal diseases. But for him, though, tuberculosis was key because he felt that this was the signal index of whether or not African Americans would be able to survive outside of slavery.</p>\n\n<p>He would say, \"Well, given these high rates of tuberculosis and other kinds of infectious diseases, we expect the Negro and the Native American to become extinct. They just simply will not be able to survive the rigors of civilization because in part, their bodies are not fit for those environments. Their intellects aren't fit to compete with us. They are not capable of engaging with us in the rough and tumble world of the marketplace. And therefore, they will simply die off.\" And that was what they believed. Of course it didn't happen.</p>\n\n<p>What's interesting about this piece is that it resonated in the minds of so many other social observers of the time, the extinction thesis. It fit into their notions of how races become ascendent in the world; it fit into their notions of how races also had degenerated - that is, had died out. And so they saw themselves at the pinnacle of civilization. They looked at other groups of people in various stages beneath them.</p>\n\n<p>So again, you see, it's a kind of reflection of an anxiety about a whole host of social issues - about the role of the freed peoples in American society, the role of Native Americans in American society, the role of all the immigrants who were coming in at that same moment in time, and what that would mean for the position, the prestige and power of the whites who basically had control of the society.</p>\n\n<p>They're worried about the threat from these other peoples and that threat and that anxiety is being expressed through the idea that, \"Look at their bodies, they're dying from disease. We can chart that, we can quantify it, we can see by looking at this that they will not be able to survive.\" It was a way of quelling their anxiety but also putting their anxiety in a way that they could in some ways control.</p>\n\n<p>It's important thing to realize that there were responses to people like Hoffman. There were people who said, \"There's something wrong with this picture and the conclusions that you draw from this picture.\" And W. E. B. DuBois was one of those people.</p>\n\n<p>DuBois suggested that if you look at tuberculosis rates among peoples who live in similar circumstances, you will see the same kinds of rates. If you compare the rates of African Americans who live in Chicago in dire conditions and you compare immigrants - groups who live in those same kinds of neighborhoods with very poor housing, bad water, probably live near the stockyards - you see high rates of tuberculosis among those groups of people as well. And therefore, tuberculosis is not an index of fitness for civilization. It is a reflection of certain kinds of environmental conditions that can be changed.</p>\n\n<p>And he was very adamant about that. So he really wanted to counter the notion of this inherent racial difference and emphasize that environment was important, if not more important in how we understand these kinds of disease rates. Now DuBois makes this argument; there are a few other commentators who also try to argue against this prevailing view of extinction. But by and large, nobody pays any attention to them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What can sports tell us about our attitudes about racial difference?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Athletic capacity is one of those ways in which we look at differences. In the 1930s, people were looking at lengths of limbs, they were measuring the body in particular kinds of ways. They weren't yet able to ask about genes.</p>\n\n<p>And so, when the African American anthropologist and physician Montague Cobb is trying to explain why Jesse Owens was such an outstanding track star, he does so by talking about his body. He talks about his feet, he talks about his legs, his calves, his chest capacity. He talks about those kinds of things, but he comes to the conclusion, of course, that you can't say that Negroes have some special characteristics that make them more fit as runners. If you look at other groups of people, you're going to see similar kinds of characteristics that make them good as runners. So he was trying to counter the argument that there are some inherent racial differences that made Jesse Owens special at that particular time.</p>\n\n<p>So now we ask whether or not athletes who are quite superior have different genes from other people. As we used to ask - does an African-American man have different limbs or feet or brain size that makes them different in other ways?</p>\n\n<p>What is downplayed is the role of training, the role of discipline, the role of the will to win and all these other kinds of things that I think most athletes would say is critical to their capacity to be successful at a particular level.</p>\n\n<p>But what we do now is begin to ask, is there something genetic? And we begin to ask those questions about genetics the same way we ask those questions about other kinds of bodily differences. Do they have different genes than other people that make them superior athletes?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why is \"blood\" such a powerful racial metaphor?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The \"one-drop rule\" was made up in the United States. It's the rule of hypo-descent. It says that if you have one drop of black \"blood\", then you are a black person in the United States. And imagine a reverse situation where one drop of white blood could make you a white person. So that rule is quite arbitrary.</p>\n\n<p>It also gives a particular power to the notion of blood. It gives a particular power to the notion of contamination, that one drop of black blood makes you black and therefore conferred upon you lesser rights of citizenship, of course, than all of the other white blood that you might have. So the one drop of black blood is a contaminant and it has powerful social consequences.</p>\n\n<p>One of the connotations associated with race is the notion of blood, of ancestry, that a race is a group of, say, horses descended from some common ancestor, and the blood of that common ancestor flows through all the descendants. You want a horse who's descended from Secretariat who won the Kentucky Derby.</p>\n\n<p>And applied to humans, I think we see it in similar ways, that blood and that notion of being \"of one blood\" is a statement about ancestry, is a statement about kinship. And it's also a statement about certain peoples versus other peoples. That our family, bound together by this common ancestor, is also bound together by a common heritage, a common set of values, a common set of behavioral characteristics that we pass on to our children. So you want to preserve your \"blood lines\"; you don't want to contaminate your blood lines.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of race, blood is something that is both metaphorical and also something real. So for example, when people first began to study and understand the notion of blood groups, they falsely thought they could use differences in blood groups to categorize races. So you move from that sort of metaphorical level that race somehow is an expression of ancestry and kinship and common stock to it being literally used by scientists to try to understand human differences at a biological level. And certainly, of course then, blood is what you also use in genetic studies as well.</p>\n\n<p>So blood is something that has all of these qualities of representing both sort of the essence of human life, but also the thing we use to try to understand human difference, the idea we use to try to think about how we're connected to our human past. So it really functions on a lot of levels, both literally and figuratively as, I think, a very important metaphor about race and how we use the concept of race.</p>\n\n<p>And even up to the Second World War blood plasma was segregated. And what you see is that many whites did not want to have \"black blood.\" Black blood was going to contaminate them as white people. The irony, of course, is that an African American physician, Charles Drew, invented the technique that enabled blood plasma to be widely used.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Do we need to worry about scientists racializing their data and conclusions today?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Scientists also now claim - and I mean scientists broadly but primarily I think people who are looking at this new genetic data - they say that we shouldn't worry about the ways in which we talked about race in the past, that scientists would never make those kinds of mistakes in their studies of human variation today.</p>\n\n<p>I think we always have to hold those kinds of comments with a kind of skepticism. Because we believe, and I think there's a lot of evidence to show, that scientists are part of their social context, that their social ideas, their ideas about what race is, are not simply scientific ones, are not simply driven by the data that they're working with. They're also informed by the societies in which they live.</p>\n\n<p>And to that extent, then, it's not a separation between science and society. It's the ways in which science is in society. And therefore our cultural and political and social beliefs about race do inform scientists' interpretation of their data about race. And I think it's important that we remember that.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not particularly worried that we'll have a repeat of the excesses of the 19th century, or the early 20th century eugenics, or the excesses of Nazism in the 1940s. I believe that what we have to worry about is how questions of human difference will be framed and what meanings we'll give to the issues of difference that will be brought to the fore by this new genetic research.</p>\n\n<p>And it will be very easy for us to look around and say, \"Ah, since the largest group of people in American prisons right now are African Americans, that's the population we should look at to study whether or not there is a gene for criminality.\" That's the thing I think we have to be worried about.</p>\n\n<p>It's often been characterized that 19th century racial science was pseudo-science. It's not pseudo-science; it was the science of the day. Morton's reputation didn't accrue to him because he was doing something that people thought was wrong. He was thought to be doing something that was correct by the standards of the day. So we have to take him in his times.</p>\n\n<p>To the extent that he was responsible and involved in using the data that he collected to justify the inferior state of African Americans, of course he did it, of course that happened. And to say that today scientists are so completely clear about the meaning of their data and the ways in which it will be used to answer questions, profound social questions about race in the United States today, to suggest that that couldn't possibly happen is incorrect. Of course that's going to happen. There are many, many ways in which it can happen.</p>\n\n<p>There will be an interpretation that scientists will give to it and there will be interpretations that people reading the newspaper will give to it. And there will be an interpretation that policymakers give to it. Because we are still a society that's organized in very important ways around notions of race, that's going to have a social consequence of enormous proportions.</p>\n\n<p>See, my bottom line is race is a human invention. Humans created it and they created it for particular uses, and it's been used in its various ways since its invention. We created it, we have used it in ways that have been in many, many respects quite negative and quite harmful. And we can think ourselves out of it.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_which_subtheme_does_this_b":[{"id":"8bd2ab46-3dab-4d28-8d25-67ebff32d455","name":"Racial Classifiation: Changing Categories","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4433de45-87b1-4a89-8fd4-378fb8776c55","name":"Racial Classification: Who Decides?"}]}},{"id":"be792eba-e162-4441-abb6-f7c943962a6d","name":"Science: Pseudoscience","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"8661596c-176b-4527-97c4-af0e614da9d8","name":"Science and Pseudoscience"}]}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Genetics","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Race Without Color (EXTERNAL ARTICLE EXAMPLE)","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"Racial classification didn't come from science but from the body's signals for differentiating attractive from unattractive sex partners, and for differentiating friend from foe."},"field_author":{"processed":"Jared Diamond"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":null}},{"title":"Why Humans haven't Evolved into Subspecies","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Believing in race as biology allows us to overlook the social factors that contribute to inequality.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"California Newsreel"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/1e294a9de8ff0733cf4c5e21bff265eb-cd24700e7e40476025f4c1c63f8f5bf1.jpg"}}}},{"title":"A Racialized Medical Genomics: Shiny, Bright and Wrong","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":true,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>End racist practices, end economic exploitation, and everybody's health improves.

So the greater the amount of variation within, the greater the number of variables that you're going to need to define a race. But why even begin to go down that road when there really is no underlying analytical or biological reality in the idea of race in the first place. On a grand scale, I really can't find a reason to think that races would have any sort of reality to them, in terms of selection and evolution.</p>"},"changed":1531506382},{"title":"How do forensics investigators determine a person's race from their DNA?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>Like some of the other questions, especially the one on bone marrow, we have to look at the assumption that is embedded in the question, which is the idea that forensic investigators actually are good at telling an individual's race from their bones or from a fragment of their DNA.

For example, the Irish were seen by the English as a separate race.

In this way, the term race, by today's standards, was used very loosely to define the other, which is different from how we think of it today.</p>\n\n<p>As Audrey mentioned, in societies before, people could be enslaved for all sorts of reasons. Originally, a slave was a person taken in combat. Rather than being killed, they were taken as a prisoner of war, and used as a forced laborer. Now, there's a very important distinction between the idea of a person as a forced laborer and the idea of a slave in the American context. If you are taken in a war and you become a forced laborer or slave, that means you are a slave because of circumstances. And the person for whom you work is in his situation because of circumstances.

Because of something peculiar to that person that made it acceptable for that person to be held in this position of forced labor, and for this condition to be passed along generation after generation after generation. Because it wasn't just circumstances. And it wasn't even something peculiar to this person. It was something peculiar to the larger group from which this person comes - a special category of human bondage. Now that, then, is what's distinctive, and it's what is so difficult for us to deal with today. This notion that people were slaves because of something peculiar to the larger group from which this person comes. Slavery is gone, but the characteristics attributed to this larger group still remain.

And you know, they talked about races of nobility, the nobility was described as being like a race of horses and dogs. There was the idea of people handing on certain characteristics to their descendants, but I think it begins to be applied to large human groups only about in the 16th century.</p>"},"field_expert_1_answer":{"processed":"<p>Let me take the latter part of that question. All European nations developed a concept of race. But these concepts were quite different from one another. For example, if you go to parts of Latin America, you find very important distinctions being made between blacks, whites, and mulattoes. In the United States with a few exceptions, the primary distinction is just black and white. So why is that?</p>\n\n<p>Well the first thing is that English settlers generally settled in family units, to a greater extent than did the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, or French in other parts of the Americas. So their contacts with blacks were generally contacts between people who needed labor and people who were forced to provide labor. In the Spanish, Dutch, French areas, obviously these contacts were also between people who needed labor and people who were forced to provide labor, but there were also sexual unions that produced children.</p>\n\n<p>This happened also in the United States, but it was more blatant and prevalent in other European - let's say the Latin American and Caribbean areas of the New World. And often in the Latin American and Caribbean areas, these European masters lived with their non-white sexual partners, and functioned with them, sometimes as families. Obviously, this was an exploitative relationship, but the people produced by these relationships, the mulattoes, often then assumed a status that was closer to the master class than was true in the United States, where there were lots of mulattoes produced but they generally assumed the status of slaves.</p>\n\n<p>I think another important factor in these different European conceptions of race is their prior experience or lack of experience with African peoples. When the Portuguese and the Spanish first went into Africa, they had lots of different terms for the varieties of African people that they saw, beyond simply black and white. A lot of this has to do with the fact that the people of the Iberian peninsula, that part of Europe where Spain and Portugal are located, had had extensive experience with African people. In 711 the Moors had invaded the Iberian peninsula and ruled that area for several hundred years. So their experience with Africans was more varied. By contrast, when the English went into Africa, the overwhelming description they provided was that which distinguished black people, which they thought they saw in Africa, and themselves, which they defined as white. It was partly the nature of these different settlements, but it was always something about the cultural backgrounds of the English versus the Spanish or Portuguese.</p>"},"field_expert_2":{"processed":"Audrey Smedley"},"field_expert_3_name":{"processed":"James Horton"},"field_expert_4_name":{"processed":"George Fredrickson"},"field_expert_4_answer":{"processed":"<p>I think what you have in the Latin American case is a sense of difference based on color, but it's a graded sense, kind of a chromatic hierarchy. In Brazil, they have 30 or 40 different descriptions of peoples' race. The whiter you are, the better, although color is not all determinative; wealth and education also can whiten you, as they say, lighten you. So it is racial, but not in the sense of black versus white. People of mixed race are an intermediate category, or there may be several intermediate categories.</p>\n\n<p>I think that it results from the high extent of miscegenation or intermarriage that existed in the early period, and the fact that, unlike Virginia and the American colonies generally, entire families didn't arrive from Europe, but rather new kinds of families were created in these circumstances. I even found that true, to some degree, in South Africa, in the 17th century where you have a lot of intermarriage going on of a very complicated sort, leading to a system where the daughters of the mixed relationships marry Europeans, but the sons become the ancestors of the so-called colored people of South Africa. A lot of the original marriage led to the founding of families that are now part of Afrikaaner population. Even in South Africa, in that early period, you had a lot of this mixing going on, so it wasn't strictly a Latin phenomenon. It also had to do with whether there was a supply of women coming from the mother country, which there wasn't in South Africa.</p>"},"relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"8bd2ab46-3dab-4d28-8d25-67ebff32d455","name":"Racial Classifiation: Changing Categories","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4433de45-87b1-4a89-8fd4-378fb8776c55","name":"Racial Classification: Who Decides?"}]}},{"id":"df7f4876-b1fa-4aa8-b905-57d5e7f14f65","name":"Who Gets to Be American: Othering and Stereotypes","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"4f251c2c-b851-45bf-ba32-ddb563cca5ae","name":"Who Belongs as an American?"}]}}],"field_article_related_content":null,"field_tags":[{"name":"Classification","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Race Without Color (EXTERNAL ARTICLE EXAMPLE)","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"Racial classification didn't come from science but from the body's signals for differentiating attractive from unattractive sex partners, and for differentiating friend from foe."},"field_author":{"processed":"Jared Diamond"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":null}},{"title":"Scientific and Folk Ideas About Heredity","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>We make sense of our place in the universe by classifying; our classifications are not necessarily derived from nature; and even when they are derived from nature, they encode cultural information.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Jonathan Marks"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/c51cd4ffaef17f2448fdce30f36ec797-bb1c2ef684bb0489a2511453032a3e2d.png"}}}},{"title":"Slavery, and the Idea of Race","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Since the Civil Rights era, we are faced with the conundrum of having arbitrary racial categories which nevertheless reflect real social experiences and are necessary to track and remedy discrimination.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"California Newsreel"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/9ce2075939e2d48f0db2848fde0b0af5-9972893df12cce8eba77938c24d03308.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"Has race always been with us?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>Today, historians and social scientists in the Western world have reached the conclusion that the concept of \"race\" is a modern idea; it did not exist before the 17th century and came into fruition gradually during the 18th century.
