Forty-two percent of the net worth of all households consists of equity in their homes - that means for most Americans, their homes are their single largest asset. Homeownership provides families with the means to invest in education, business opportunities, retirement and resources for the next generation.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>When the federal government stepped in to make it possible for most Americans to finance the purchase of their own home, they essentially paved the way for millions of average white Americans to begin their own wealth-building. But the policies they endorsed made it very difficult for minorities to attain the same resources and opportunities, resulting in deeply segregated communities and an enormous wealth gap between whites and nonwhites that persists to this day. In 1995, the median white family had over 8 times the net worth of the median Black family. The gap is even greater for Latinos - the median white household has over 12 times the wealth of the median Latino family.</p>\n\n<p>Race, wealth and life opportunities are intertwined in the United States. Today, white and nonwhite communities are still \"separate and unequal\" and the gap continues to grow, long after the Civil Rights era. Wealth, and the opportunities it affords, is passed down through successive generations. Along with it, Americans have also inherited a legacy of inequality that continues to shape the future. Segregation and the wealth gap between whites and nonwhites did not arise on their own. And because they are so deeply entrenched in the institutions that structure our society, they will not fade away by simply outlawing discriminatory policies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the state of segregation in the nation's metropolitan areas today? </strong></p>\n\n<p>The U.S. population is more racially and ethnically diverse than ever before. Yet for the most part, America's neighborhoods remain highly segregated. The only areas that have become more integrated since 1970 are cities with small minority populations.</p>\n\n<p>On the whole, segregation is highest in the major metropolitan areas of the Midwest and Northeast and lower in the West and South.</p>\n\n<p>The 2000 census shows that overall the nation's largest cities have lost large numbers of white residents to suburban and outlying areas. The urban populace is becoming increasingly Latino and Asian, with a slight increase in Black residents.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Lewis Mumford Center at the University of Albany, segregation has increased in almost every large suburban area from 1990 to 2000.</p>\n\n<p>Across the nation, four out of five whites live outside of the cities and 86 percent of whites live in neighborhoods where minorities make up less than 1 percent of the population. In contrast, 70 percent of Blacks and Latinos live in the cities or inner-ring suburbs.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Census Bureau's 1999 American Housing Survey, 74 percent of suburban residents owned their own homes, while only about half of urban residents are homeowners. The proportion is similar when you compare homeowners by race - in 1999, 74 percent of whites were homeowners, while only 45 percent of Latinos, 46 percent of Blacks and 51 percent of Asians owned their homes.</p>\n\n<p>Whites are still the most segregated of all racial groups, have the largest suburban presence and are most likely to own their homes. African Americans continue to be highly segregated and as Latinos and Asians gain a larger share of the population, they are becoming increasingly segregated from whites as well. </p>\n\n<p>When whites relocated to the suburbs, their strong tax base and businesses followed. The result: a huge discrepancy in the quality and quantity of resources, jobs and public services in central cities and inner-ring suburbs inhabited by mostly minority populations. As white communities continue the trend of isolating themselves and their resources, the pattern of flight and divestment repeats, and the wealth gap grows larger. </p>\n\n<p>Communities cannot be expected to accomplish integrated, stable neighborhoods on their own. In a 2002 study by the Harvard Civil Rights Project, analysts found evidence of an overwhelming trend toward school district resegregation. Court-ordered busing once made Southern schools the most integrated in the country. However, when many of these programs expired in the 1990s, the proportion of Black students in majority-white schools decreased by 13 percent. Until the problem of residential seclusion is addressed, schools will continue to resegregate by default.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But aren't some communities segregated by choice? What about the Chinatowns, Little Ethiopias and other ethnic enclaves?</strong></p>\n\n<p>People sometimes assume that certain ethnic or racial groups segregate themselves \"voluntarily,\" but there are many factors involved. These groups often face discrimination when they try to enter established, primarily white communities. Limited job and economic opportunities, language barriers, and shared culture can also influence many groups to cluster. Ethnic enclaves, however, are very different from impoverished urban ghettos. Apart from \"first-settlement\" immigrant neighborhoods, rarely do ethnic groups ever become as highly concentrated as many Black communities. Ethnic groups can tap into various types of resources unavailable to areas of concentrated poverty: networks of friends and relatives, \"niche\" occupations and businesses, etc. Furthermore, ethnic enclaves are more transitory in nature - as stepping stones to entering more privileged, resource-rich communities. Still, many groups (such as Latinos and Asians) will face more barriers based on racial discrimination as they look to move out. </p>\n\n<p>Confronted with racially discriminatory policies, minorities could not take advantage of the programs that made it possible for millions of people to buy homes in the suburbs. People of color remained in the cities while they witnessed their white counterparts leave in droves. Today, mostly minority inner cities are characterized by the unique phenomenon of concentrated poverty. Inner-city residents face intense spatial isolation and inadequate public resources, education and economic opportunities. As more and more people leave, costs for basic services rise and the poor become even poorer. The average inner city consists of abandoned buildings, total business disinvestment, and resource-depleted schools leaving it vulnerable to violent crime, prostitution, and drugs. By the time anti-discriminatory laws were passed, suburban whites were enjoying soaring property values and minorities now faced the economic barriers that replaced those initially created by race. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, after decades of segregation, a culture of poverty has become associated with people of color - particularly African Americans. Inner-city residents are not only surrounded by crime, drugs, homelessness and poverty, they are blamed for it. As john powell says, \"Not only have we racialized our space, but it is through space that we do our 'racing' in the 20th century.\" </p>\n\n<p><strong>How does discrimination, both past and present, continue to affect the life opportunities of nonwhites?</strong></p>\n\n<p>In 1992, The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released a study showing that Black and Latino mortgage applicants are 60 percent more likely to be turned down for loans than whites, even when they share similar employment and financial backgrounds. </p>\n\n<p>According to a 1998 report by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), African-American mortgage applicants were rejected 217 percent as often as whites - up from 206 percent in 1995. Latino applicants were denied 183 percent as often as whites - up from 169 percent in 1995.</p>\n\n<p>According to a Department of Housing and Urban Development study, high-cost loans are offered five times more often in Black neighborhoods than in white neighborhoods. Furthermore, homeowners in upper-income Black neighborhoods were twice as likely to receive these sort of loans than homeowners in low-income white neighborhoods. In 1998, 9 percent of home loans in white neighborhoods were high cost compared to 51 percent of loans in Black neighborhoods.</p>\n\n<p>In 2003, we celebrate the 35th anniversary of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Nonetheless, housing discrimination persists in subtler forms. Minorities still experience discrimination on an individual level as well as through a variety of systematic practices. Realtors who practice racial steering will direct nonwhites to segregated areas or direct whites away from integrated areas. Minority mortgage applicants who are regularly denied loans more often than their white socioeconomic equals will by necessity turn to predatory lenders who charge them higher-cost loans than their credit histories warrant.</p>\n\n<p>As long as minorities are still barred from desirable communities and lose out on opportunities to accumulate wealth through rising property values, socioeconomic inequalities between racial groups will continue to be reinforced. Even if individual incidences of discrimination are no longer, the current housing market makes it almost impossible for a family with little or no assets to enter it. As home prices in resource-rich communities continue to rise, low to middle-income families must choose between renting or buying in at-risk, often segregated suburban communities. </p>\n\n<p>Ironically, defenders of the racial bias in the home lending system will point to the low net worth of minority applicants, even those with high incomes. As George Lipsitz points out, \"net worth is almost totally determined by past opportunities for asset accumulation, and therefore is the one figure most likely to reflect the history of discrimination.\"</p>"}},{"id":"53fbbef1-4d9c-4444-a8c2-6c86c95861c2","field_old_article_discl":{"processed":"<p>NOTE: This article was originally published in 2003, and is included here for reference.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"field_author_bio":{"processed":"<p>Larry Adelman is Series Executive Producer of RACE - The Power of an Illusion and co-director of California Newsreel.</p>"},"field_copyright":{"processed":"<p>San Francisco Chronicle, Sunday, June 29, 2003</p>"},"title":"Racial Preferences for Whites: The Houses That Racism Built","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_subtheme":[{"id":"e1364a55-f51c-423a-8ca8-aa358bfcf496","name":"Structured Advantage: Legislation and Government Policy","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"db1af52f-dd0f-4bb0-a7ea-46c6817923f3","name":"Structured Advantage and Disadvantage"}]}},{"id":"66d1f34e-1b54-4f88-a147-9a0e19aeac3a","name":"Racial Wealth Gap: Housing and Ownership","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"72d34ba2-6377-4c6f-aacd-7cee0dc2e704","name":"The Racial Wealth Gap"}]}},{"id":"b6696374-c1d9-45c7-b69a-41da2314f0a9","name":"Racial Wealth Gap: Intergenerational Wealth and Poverty","relationships":{"field_belongs_to_theme":[{"id":"72d34ba2-6377-4c6f-aacd-7cee0dc2e704","name":"The Racial Wealth Gap"}]}}],"field_article_related_content":[{"__typename":"node__article","title":"Segregated Housing and the Racial Wealth Gap","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>As long as minorities are still barred from desirable communities and lose out on opportunities to accumulate wealth through rising property values, socioeconomic inequalities between racial groups will continue to be reinforced.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/d6496c4a4fa69484ccfc4c847216fa83-e219e7eeef7ed6a01062b712d491d368.png"}}}},{"__typename":"node__article","title":"A Long History of Racial Preferences: For Whites","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":true,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>'Colorblind' policies that treat everyone the same, no exceptions for minorities, are often counter-posed against affirmative action. But colorblindness today merely bolsters the unfair advantages that color-coded practices have enabled white Americans.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/ab4690dfbce44c9414a5efd011ceac7e-8fd8740226c51ef8372e0937112a4b0f.png"}}}},{"__typename":"node__article","title":"The Hidden Cost of Being African American","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Whites are wealthier than African Americans, and whites' wealth advantage is much bigger than their advantages in either income or education.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Michael Hout"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/0a1fc3d4330a47ec850c96f3157f65c1-fb6f0139a08046e54ad296e9c98f2815.png"}}}}],"field_tags":[{"name":"Suburbs/Suburbanization","relationships":{"backref_field_tags_node_article":[{"title":"Segregated Housing and the Racial Wealth Gap","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>As long as minorities are still barred from desirable communities and lose out on opportunities to accumulate wealth through rising property values, socioeconomic inequalities between racial groups will continue to be reinforced.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/d6496c4a4fa69484ccfc4c847216fa83-e219e7eeef7ed6a01062b712d491d368.png"}}}},{"title":"Racial Preferences for Whites: The Houses That Racism Built","field_include_in_the_teaching_se":false,"field_short_version":{"processed":"<p>Racism doesn't just come dressed in white sheets or voiced by skinheads, but lies in institutions that, like the FHA, have quietly and often invisibly channeled America's wealth, power, and status disproportionately to white people.</p>"},"field_author":{"processed":"Larry Adelman"},"relationships":{"field_main_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/f188f438c2a2a0181c47cdd2625c6d02-6cfb2b646ada899d7713c775751d246b.png"}}}}],"backref_field_tag_node_faq":[{"title":"What policies might integrate the suburbs and remedy some of the inequities that stem from residential segregation?","field_expert_1":{"value":"<p>The racial situation in America is in the interest of those who are racially privileged (i.e., whites) and nowhere does the rubber hit the road more than in real estate.

It was a ranch house on a curving, leafy street in Merrick, Long Island, 25 miles east of Manhattan, about five miles from its more famous suburban neighbor, Levittown.</p>"},"field_full_version":{"processed":"<p>After turning 65, my father wasted no time retiring. He'd purchased our house back in 1952 for $20,000 thanks to a 4 percent mortgage made possible by the Veterans Administration. Now he was considering an offer of $300,000. With the money they'd get a place in the Berkshires and winter in Florida.</p>\n\n<p>Ten years later, my colleague here at California Newsreel, Cornelius, sold the house he grew up in. Cornelius' folks had also purchased a place in the early '50s in Chester, just outside Philadelphia. A few years ago, after Cornelius' father passed away, his mother wanted to move back to Virginia. Cornelius sold the home in 2000 - for $29,500.</p>\n\n<p>That $270,500 gap reveals a microcosm of race in America. My family is white and Cornelius' is black.</p>\n\n<p>On Monday, the Supreme Court finally issued its ruling on whether the University of Michigan should jettison its affirmative action program. The court upheld the law school program that sought a \"critical mass\" of minorities but struck down a \"point system\" used to increase affirmative action for undergraduates. While the decisions didn't fully satisfy advocates on either side, on balance they were less \"anti-affirmative action\" than feared. I wonder how many justices had experiences like mine.</p>\n\n<p>Cornelius and I have worked together for 20 years, always making an identical salary, yet my net worth is several times his. My two brothers and I enjoyed good schools, parks and libraries because of rising property values. My parents' growing home equity not only provided for their retirement but sent the three of us to private colleges - and even helped with the down-payments on our own homes. Today, thanks to them, my house is paid off and my 21-year-old daughter is about to graduate college with a nest egg of her own. When my parents pass away, we stand to inherit a tidy sum.</p>\n\n<p>Cornelius had no such help. As American manufacturing declined, Chester became increasingly black and populated by people on fixed incomes, who faced higher taxes to maintain public services and schools. Cornelius' parents' expenses climbed as their city deteriorated. Cornelius attended college on scholarship, but worked his way through school. Today, rather than look to his mother for financial help, Cornelius helps support her.</p>\n\n<p>What's this got to with race? It goes back to the postwar suburbs and the government policies and subsidies that made them possible -- and guaranteed they'd be segregated.</p>\n\n<p>A set of New Deal programs led by the Federal Housing Administration allowed millions of average white Americans to own a home for the first time. Down payment requirements were reduced from as much as 50 percent to 10 or 20 percent and the time to pay off the remaining mortgage was extended from five years to 30 years.</p>\n\n<p>Federal investigators evaluated 239 regions for risk. Communities with a mere one or two black families were deemed ipso facto financial risks ineligible for low cost home loans. Government appraisal maps colored those communities red -- hence the origin of the term \"redlining.\"</p>\n\n<p>Between 1934 and 1962, the federal government backed $120 billion of home loans; more than 98 percent went to whites. Of the 350,000 new homes built with federal support here in Northern California between 1946 and 1960, fewer than 100 went to African Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Barred from purchasing a home in the new post-War suburbs, Cornelius' parents had to buy in one of the few communities where black people could live.</p>\n\n<p>Today, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, the typical white family has ten times the net worth of the typical black family (nine times the net worth of the typical Latino family). Even when they make the same income, white families have over twice the wealth. Much of that gap is due to home equity and family inheritance.</p>\n\n<p>Many whites who grew up middle class in the suburbs like to think we got where we are today on merit - hard work, intelligence, pluck and maybe a little luck. We wonder why non-white parents didn't just work hard, buy a home and pass on the appreciated value like our parents did. We tend to be blind to how the playing field has been - and continues to be - tilted to our advantage.</p>\n\n<p>Racism doesn't just come dressed in white sheets or voiced by skinheads, but lies in institutions that, like the FHA, have quietly and often invisibly channeled America's wealth, power, and status disproportionately to white people. Those advantages are passed on and accumulate, generation to generation, giving us a head start in life. As Ohio State University law professor john a. powell observes: \"The slick thing about whiteness is that whites are getting the spoils of a racist system without themselves being personally racist.\"</p>\n\n<p>I sit on my back deck today, enjoying the blooms of the wisteria and reading an e-mail from my daughter about her post-college plans. My daughter certainly had nothing to do with slavery or Jim Crow. But the past still helps shape her future thanks to the many advantages my parents, me, and now she have accrued thanks to generations of racial preferences -- for white people.</p>"}}],"clips":[{"title":"Victoria Robinson shares how she uses her favorite clip on redlining in her teaching","field_external_video_url":{"uri":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/280782466","title":""},"relationships":{"field_poster_image":{"localFile":{"publicURL":"/static/4580576fe9e74f76d3dae0589b93547e-ef1f6d2046a823c9596262bed16a9fda.png"}}}}],"interviews":[{"title":"Interview with Dalton Conley","changed":1530933218,"field_interviewee_bio":{"processed":"<p>Dalton Conley is director of the Center for Advanced Social Science Research (CASSR) and an associate professor in the Department of Sociology at New York University.

There is a premium in housing values to live in a lily-white community, as opposed to a minority community, or an integrated community. When whites are the majority group and control most of the money, the task of changing that dynamic is very difficult. One way is to create tax incentives and create \"integration insurance\" in the private sector. If I'm a white homeowner and the racial composition of my neighborhood is integrating, I've probably heard that the tipping point for the devaluation of properties is when the percentage of black residents reaches 15 to 20 percent. Therefore, it's in my interest to sell before I think that the neighborhood \"tips,\" because I'm going to lose money if I wait too long and the real estate values decline. Now, even if I'm not personally racist, it's in my economic interest to sell my house.

There is a premium in housing values to live in a lily-white community, as opposed to a minority community, or an integrated community. When whites are the majority group and control most of the money, the task of changing that dynamic is very difficult. One way is to create tax incentives and create \"integration insurance\" in the private sector. If I'm a white homeowner and the racial composition of my neighborhood is integrating, I've probably heard that the tipping point for the devaluation of properties is when the percentage of black residents reaches 15 to 20 percent. Therefore, it's in my interest to sell before I think that the neighborhood \"tips,\" because I'm going to lose money if I wait too long and the real estate values decline. Now, even if I'm not personally racist, it's in my economic interest to sell my house.
