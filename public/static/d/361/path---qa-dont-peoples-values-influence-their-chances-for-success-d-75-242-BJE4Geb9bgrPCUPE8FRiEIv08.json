And significantly, the answer to that varies by ethnic group, by a group's particular history in the United States, and even by the period in U.S. history we're talking about. But to bring it up to the present, we cannot generalize about blacks or Asians or Middle Eastern or white immigrants, because their statuses have changed. Nonetheless, there are some things that I would argue are constant. First, the vast majority of immigrants who come to this country do so not just because they want to, but also because they have family, extended family, or other links to immigrant communities here, and those extended immigrant communities provide networks. These networks have access to capital and job markets that help these new immigrants get established and eventually accumulate wealth.

Furthermore there are simply far more blacks in the United States than there are poor recent immigrants, hence the wealth of their middle-class counterparts is spread even more thinly. This gets back to this issue that is so central to the film series: the long history of the political and economic discrimination against certain racial groups. The black middle class and other minority middle classes are equity poor in large part because of this long history. To this day, it's still comparably much more difficult for certain groups to accumulate wealth.

And it's significant to note which groups these are. Hispanic immigrants historically have had a much harder time accumulating wealth than other immigrants, be they European, Asian, or Middle Eastern. Poor black immigrants from the Caribbean, South America, and Africa, have also not fared as well. Likewise, many recent Asian immigrants have come to this country quite destitute, often fleeing political turmoil in the '70s and '80s, and they have likewise struggled in comparison to Asians from other regions, or those who came in other time periods.

Consider some of the most often cited causes for black or Hispanic poverty. You mentioned some: lack of investment in education, poor parenting, excessive substance abuse, domestic abuse, criminality, inability to save money. This might be a persuasive argument if, for example, the rates of substance abuse or domestic violence were statistically higher among the poor or among minorities. But they're not. They plague all communities - white and non-white, rich and poor - but have very different impacts on those communities because some people are largely immune to serious police action, because sentencing practices vary considerably by race, and because affluent people generally have many ways to hide these kinds of behaviors from public view.</p>\n\n<p>For example, one of the subgroups in the United States with the highest rate of spousal abuse is police officers. There's also a noticeable spike in reports of domestic violence this year in families of U.S. military personnel. Yet we don't see that fact alone plunging their families into poverty, nor do we see many exposés on the cultural values of the police and military communities on the evening news.
